3 3 IMDG Code (Amendment 41-22) 2022 EDITION Chapter 3.1 General 3.1.1 Scope and general provisions 3.1.1.1 The Dangerous Goods List in chapter 3.2 lists many of the dangerous goods most commonly transported. The list includes entries for specific chemical substances and articles and generic or ‚Äúnot otherwise specified‚Äù entries. Since it is not practical to include a separate entry for every chemical substance or article of commercial importance specifically by name, especially names for mixtures and solutions of various chemical constituents and concentrations, the Dangerous Goods List also includes generic or ‚Äúnot otherwise specified‚Äù names (e.g. EXTRACTS, LIQUID, for flavour or aroma, UN 1197 or FLAMMABLE LIQUID, N.O.S., UN 1993). On this basis, the Dangerous Goods List is intended to include an appropriate name or entry for any dangerous good which may be transported. 3.1.1.2 Where a dangerous good is specifically listed by name in the Dangerous Goods List, it shall be transported in accordance with the provisions in the List which are appropriate for that dangerous good. A generic or ‚Äúnot otherwise specified‚Äù entry may be used to permit the transport of substances, materials or articles which do not appear specifically by name in the Dangerous Goods List. Such a dangerous good may be transported only after its dangerous properties have been determined. Dangerous goods shall be classified according to the class definitions, tests and criteria. The name which most appropriately describes the dangerous goods shall be used. Only when the specific name of the dangerous goods does not appear in the Dangerous Goods List or the associated primary or subsidiary hazards assigned to it are not appropriate may a generic or ‚Äúnot otherwise specified‚Äù name be used. The classification shall be made by the shipper/consignor or by the appropriate competent authority where so specified in the Code. Once the class of the dangerous good has been so established, all conditions for transport, as provided in this Code, shall be met. Any dangerous good having or suspected of having explosive characteristics shall first be considered for inclusion in class 1. Some collective entries may be of the generic or ‚Äúnot otherwise specified‚Äù type provided that the Code contains provisions ensuring safety, both by excluding extremely dangerous goods from normal transport and by covering all subsidiary hazards inherent in some goods. 3.1.1.3 Inherent instability in goods may take different dangerous forms, for example explosion, polymerization with intense evolution of heat or emission of flammable, toxic, corrosive or asphyxiant gases. The Dangerous Goods List indicates that certain dangerous goods, or dangerous goods in a specific form, concentration or state, are prohibited for transport by sea. This means that the goods specified are not suitable for transport by sea under normal conditions of transport. This does not mean that such goods may not be transported under any circumstances. For most goods, such inherent instability can be controlled by suitable packaging, dilution, stabilization, addition of an inhibitor, temperature control or other measures. 3.1.1.4 Where precautionary measures are laid down in the Dangerous Goods List in respect of a given dangerous good (such as that it shall be ‚Äústabilized‚Äù or ‚Äúwith x % water or phlegmatizer‚Äù), such dangerous good may not normally be transported when these measures have not been taken, unless the item in question is listed elsewhere (such as class 1) without any indication of, or with different, precautionary measures. 3.1.1.5 Certain substances, by the nature of their chemical composition, tend to polymerize or otherwise react in a dangerous manner under certain conditions of temperature or in contact with a catalyst. Mitigation of this tendency can be carried out either by requiring special transport conditions or by adding adequate amounts of chemical inhibitors or stabilizers to the product. These products shall be sufficiently stabilized to prevent any dangerous reaction during the intended voyage. If this cannot be ensured, the transport of such products is prohibited. 3.1.1.6 Where the contents of a portable tank is to be transported heated, the transport temperature is to be maintained during the intended voyage unless it is established that crystallization or solidification on cooling would not result in instability, which can occur with some stabilized or inhibited products.

Part 3 ‚Äì Dangerous Goods List, special provisions and exceptions 4 IMDG Code (Amendment 41-22) 2022 EDITION 3 3.1.2 Proper shipping names Note 1 : The proper shipping names of the dangerous goods are those listed in chapter 3.2, Dangerous Goods List. Synonyms, secondary names, initials, abbreviations of names, etc. have been included in the Index to facilitate the search for the proper shipping name (see part 5, Consignment procedures). Note 2 : For proper shipping names to be used for transport of samples, see 2.0.4. For proper shipping names to be used for transport of wastes, see 5.4.1.4.3.3. 3.1.2.1 The proper shipping name is that portion of the entry most accurately describing the goods in the Dangerous Goods List, which is shown in upper-case characters (plus any numbers, Greek letters, ‚Äò sec ‚Äô, ‚Äò tert ‚Äô, and the letters m , n , o , p , which form an integral part of the name). An alternative proper shipping name may be shown in brackets following the main proper shipping name (such as ETHANOL (ETHYL ALCOHOL)). Portions of an entry appearing in lower case need not be considered as part of the proper shipping name but may be used. 3.1.2.2 When a combination of several distinct proper shipping names are listed under a single UN number, and these are separated by ‚Äúand‚Äù or ‚Äúor‚Äù in lower case or are punctuated by commas, only the most appropriate shall be shown in the transport document and package marks. Examples illustrating the selection of the proper shipping name for such entries are: .1 UN 1057 LIGHTERS or LIGHTER REFILLS ‚Äì The proper shipping name is the most appropriate of the following possible combinations: LIGHTERS LIGHTER REFILLS; .2 UN 2583 ALKYLSULPHONIC ACIDS, SOLID or ARYLSULPHONIC ACIDS, SOLID with more than 5% free sulphuric acid ‚Äì The proper shipping name is the most appropriate of the following: ALKYLSULPHONIC ACIDS, SOLID ARYLSULPHONIC ACIDS, SOLID; .3 UN 2793 FERROUS METAL BORINGS, SHAVINGS, TURNINGS or CUTTINGS in a form liable to self-heating. The proper shipping name is the most appropriate of the following combinations: FERROUS METAL BORINGS FERROUS METAL SHAVINGS FERROUS METAL TURNINGS FERROUS METAL CUTTINGS. 3.1.2.3 Proper shipping names may be used in the singular or plural as appropriate. In addition, when qualifying words are used as part of the proper shipping name, their sequence on documentation or packages is optional. Commercial or military names for goods of class 1, which contain the proper shipping name supplemented by additional text, may be used. 3.1.2.4 Many substances have an entry for both the liquid and solid state (see definitions for liquids and solids in 1.2.1), or for the solid and solution. These are allocated separate UN numbers which are not necessarily adjacent to each other. Details are provided in the alphabetical index, e.g.: NITROXYLENES, LIQUID ‚Äì 6.1 1665 NITROXYLENES, SOLID ‚Äì 6.1 3447. 3.1.2.5 Where it is not already included, the qualifying word ‚ÄúMOLTEN‚Äù shall be added to the proper shipping name when a substance which is solid in accordance with the definition in 1.2.1 is offered for transport in the molten state (such as ALKYLPHENOL, SOLID, N.O.S., MOLTEN). For elevated temperature substances, see 5.4.1.4.3.4. 3.1.2.6 Except for self-reactive substances and organic peroxides and unless it is already included in capital letters in the name indicated in the Dangerous Goods List, the word STABILIZED shall be added as part of the proper shipping name of the substance which without stabilization would be forbidden from transport in accordance with 1.1.3 due to it being liable to dangerously react under conditions normally encountered in transport (such as TOXIC LIQUID, ORGANIC, N.O.S., STABILIZED). When temperature control is used to stabilize such substances to prevent the development of any dangerous excess pressure, or the evolution of excessive heat, or when chemical stabilization is used in combination with temperature control, then: .1 For liquids and solids where the SAPT (measured without or with inhibitor, when chemical stabilization is applied) is less than or equal to that prescribed in 2.4.2.5.2, special provision 386 of chapter 3.3 and the provisions of 7.3.7 apply; .2 Unless it is already included in capital letters in the name indicated in the Dangerous Goods List, the words ‚ÄúTEMPERATURE CONTROLLED‚Äù shall be added as part of the proper shipping name; .3 For gases: the conditions of transport shall be approved by the competent authority. 3.1.2.7 Hydrates may be transported under the proper shipping name for the anhydrous substance.

Chapter 3.1 ‚Äì General 5 IMDG Code (Amendment 41-22) 2022 EDITION 3 3.1.2.8 Generic or ‚Äúnot otherwise specified‚Äù (N.O.S.) entries 3.1.2.8.1 Generic and ‚Äúnot otherwise specified‚Äù proper shipping names that are assigned to special provision 274 or 318 in column 6 of the Dangerous Goods List shall be supplemented with the technical or chemical group names unless a national law or international convention prohibits its disclosure if it is a controlled substance. For explosives of class 1, the dangerous goods description may be supplemented by additional descriptive text to indicate commercial or military names. Technical and chemical group names shall be entered in brackets immediately following the proper shipping name. An appropriate modifier, such as ‚Äúcontains‚Äù or ‚Äúcontaining‚Äù or other qualifying words such as ‚Äúmixture‚Äù, ‚Äúsolution‚Äù, etc., and the percentage of the technical constituent may also be used. For example: ‚ÄúUN 1993 Flammable liquid, n.o.s. (contains xylene and benzene), 3, PG II‚Äù. 3.1.2.8.1.1 The technical name shall be a recognized chemical or biological name or other name currently used in scientific and technical handbooks, journals and texts. Trade names shall not be used for this purpose. In the case of pesticides, only ISO common name(s), other name(s) in The WHO Recommended Classification of Pesticides by Hazard and Guidelines to Classification , or the name(s) of the active substance(s) may be used. 3.1.2.8.1.2 When a mixture of dangerous goods or articles containing dangerous goods are described by one of the ‚ÄúN.O.S.‚Äù or ‚Äúgeneric‚Äù entries to which special provision 274 has been allocated in the Dangerous Goods List, not more than the two constituents which most predominantly contribute to the hazard or hazards of the mixture or of the articles need to be shown, excluding controlled substances when their disclosure is prohibited by national law or international convention. If a package containing a mixture is labelled with any subsidiary hazard label, one of the two technical names shown in brackets shall be the name of the constituent which compels the use of the subsidiary hazard label. 3.1.2.8.1.3 Examples illustrating the selection of the proper shipping name supplemented with the technical name of goods for such N.O.S. entries are: UN 2902 PESTICIDE, LIQUID, TOXIC, N.O.S. (drazoxolon) UN 3394 ORGANOMETALLIC SUBSTANCE, LIQUID, PYROPHORIC, WATER-REACTIVE (trimethylgallium). UN 3540 ARTICLES CONTAINING FLAMMABLE LIQUID, N.O.S. (pyrrolidine) 3.1.2.9 Marine pollutants 3.1.2.9.1 For the purpose of documentation, the proper shipping name of ‚Äúnot otherwise specified‚Äù (N.O.S.) entries which are classified as marine pollutants in accordance with 2.10.3, shall be supplemented with the recognized chemical name of the constituent which most predominantly contributes to the classification as marine pollutant unless otherwise provided by SP274. 3.1.2.9.2 An example illustrating the selection of the proper shipping name supplemented with the recognized technical name of goods for such entries are is indicated below: UN 1993 FLAMMABLE LIQUID, N.O.S. (propyl acetate, di- n -butyltin di-2-ethylhexanoate) class 3 PG III (50 ¬∞ C c.c.) MARINE POLLUTANT 3.1.3 Mixtures or solutions Note: Where a substance is specifically listed by name in the Dangerous Goods List, it shall be identified in transport by the proper shipping name in the Dangerous Goods List. Such substances may contain technical impurities (for example those deriving from the production process) or additives for stability or other purposes that do not affect their classification. However, a substance listed by name containing technical impurities or additives for stability or other purposes affecting its classification shall be considered a mixture or solution (see 2.0.2.2 and 2.0.2.5). 3.1.3.1 A mixture or solution is not subject to the provisions of this Code if the characteristics, properties, form or physical state of the mixture or solution are such that it does not meet the criteria, including human experience criteria, for inclusion in any class. 3.1.3.2 A mixture or solution meeting the classification criteria of this Code composed of a single predominant substance identified by name in the Dangerous Goods List and one or more substances not subject to the provisions of this Code and/or traces of one or more substances identified by name in the Dangerous Goods List, shall be assigned the UN number and proper shipping name of the predominant substance named in the Dangerous Goods List unless: .1 the mixture or solution is identified by name in the Dangerous Goods List; .2 the name and description of the substance named in the Dangerous Goods List specifically indicate that they apply only to the pure substance; .3 the hazard class or division, subsidiary hazard(s), packing group, or physical state of the mixture or solution is different from that of the substance named in the Dangerous Goods List; or IMDG Code Vol. 2 Applicable from: 2024-01-01/2023-01-01 on a voluntary basis

In addition, the concentration of the mixture or solution may also be indicated after the basic description of the mixture or solution, for example, ‚ÄúACETONE 75% SOLUTION‚Äù. 3.1.3.4 A mixture or solution meeting the classification criteria of this Code that is not identified by name in the Dangerous Goods List and that is composed of two or more dangerous goods shall be assigned to an entry that has the proper shipping name, description, hazard class or division, subsidiary hazard(s) and packing group that most precisely describe the mixture or solution. 3.1.4 Segregation groups 3.1.4.1 For the purpose of segregation, dangerous goods having certain similar chemical properties have been grouped together in segregation groups, see 7.2.5. 3.1.4.2 It is recognized that not all substances, mixtures, solutions or preparations falling within a segregation group are listed in the IMDG Code by name. These are shipped under N.O.S. entries. Although these N.O.S. entries are not themselves listed in the segregation groups (see 3.1.4.4), the consignor shall decide whether inclusion under the segregation group is appropriate and, if so, shall mention that fact in the transport document (see 5.4.1.5.11). 3.1.4.3 The segregation groups in this Code do not cover substances which fall outside the classification criteria of the Code. It is recognized that some non-hazardous substances have similar chemical properties as substances listed in the segregation groups. A consignor or the person responsible for packing the goods into a cargo transport unit who does have knowledge of the chemical properties of such non-dangerous goods may decide to implement the segregation provisions of a related segregation group on a voluntary basis. 3.1.4.4 The following segregation groups are identified. 1 Acids (SGG1) 1052 Hydrogen fluoride, anhydrous 1182 Ethyl chloroformate 1183 Ethyldichlorosilane 1238 Methyl chloroformate 1242 Methyldichlorosilane 1250 Methyltrichlorosilane 1295 Trichlorosilane 1298 Trimethylchlorosilane 1305 Vinyltrichlorosilane 1572 Cacodylic acid 1595 Dimethyl sulphate 1715 Acetic anhydride 1716 Acetyl bromide 1717 Acetyl chloride 1718 Butyl acid phosphate 1722 Allyl chloroformate 1723 Allyl iodide 1724 Allyltrichlorosilane, stabilized 1725 Aluminium bromide, anhydrous 1726 Aluminium chloride, anhydrous 1727 Ammonium hydrogendifluoride, solid 1728 Amyltrichlorosilane 1729 Anisoyl chloride 1730 Antimony pentachloride, liquid 1731 Antimony pentachloride solution ‚ñ≥ ‚ñ≥ IMDG Code Vol. 2 Applicable from: 2024-01-01/2023-01-01 on a voluntary basis

3 21 IMDG Code (Amendment 41-22) 2022 EDITION Chapter 3.2 Dangerous Goods List 3.2.1 Structure of the Dangerous Goods List The Dangerous Goods List is divided into 18 columns as follows: Column 1 UN No. ‚Äì this column contains the United Nations number assigned to a dangerous good by the United Nations Sub-Committee of Experts on the Transport of Dangerous Goods (UN List). Column 2 Proper shipping name (PSN) ‚Äì this column contains the proper shipping names in upper- case characters, which may have to be followed by additional descriptive text in lower-case characters (see 3.1.2). Proper shipping names may be shown in plural where isomers of similar classification exist. Hydrates may be included under the proper shipping name for the anhydrous substances. Unless otherwise indicated for an entry in the Dangerous Goods List, the word ‚ÄúSOLUTION‚Äù in a proper shipping name means one or more named dangerous goods dissolved in a liquid that is not otherwise subject to this Code. When a flashpoint is mentioned in this column, the data is based on closed-cup (c.c.) methods. Column 3 Class or division ‚Äì this column contains the class and, in the case of class 1, the division and the compatibility group assigned to the substance or article according to the classification system described in part 2, chapter 2.1. Column 4 Subsidiary hazard(s) ‚Äì this column contains the class number(s) of any subsidiary hazard(s) which have been identified by applying the classification system described in part 2. This column also identifies a dangerous good as a marine pollutant as follows: P ‚Äì Marine pollutant: a non-exhaustive list of known marine pollutants, based on previous criteria and assignment. The absence of the symbol P or the presence of a ‚Äú‚Äì‚Äù in that column does not preclude the application of 2.10.3. Column 5 Packing group ‚Äì this column contains the packing group number (i.e. I, II or III) where assigned to the substance or article. If more than one packing group is indicated for the entry, the packing group of the substance or formulation to be transported shall be determined, based on its properties, through application of the hazard grouping criteria as provided in part 2. Column 6 Special provisions ‚Äì this column contains a number referring to any special provision(s) indicated in chapter 3.3 that is relevant to the substance or article. Special provisions apply to all packing groups permitted for a particular substance or article unless the wording makes it otherwise apparent. The special provision numbers specific to the sea mode start from 900. Note: When a special provision is no longer needed, this special provision is deleted but the special provision number is not allocated again, in order not to confuse the users of this Code. For this reason, some of the numbers are missing. Column 7a Limited quantities ‚Äì this column provides the maximum quantity per inner packaging or article for transporting dangerous goods as limited quantities in accordance with chapter 3.4. Column 7b Excepted quantities ‚Äì this column provides an alpha-numeric code described in subsection 3.5.1.2 which indicates the maximum quantity per inner and outer packaging for transporting dangerous goods as excepted quantities in accordance with chapter 3.5. Column 8 Packing instructions ‚Äì this column contains alpha-numeric codes which refer to the relevant packing instruction(s) in 4.1.4. The packing instructions indicate the packagings (including large packagings) which may be used for the transport of substances and articles. A code including the letter ‚ÄúP‚Äù refers to packing instructions for the use of packagings described in chapter 6.1, 6.2 or 6.3.

Part 3 ‚Äì Dangerous Goods List, special provisions and exceptions 22 IMDG Code (Amendment 41-22) 2022 EDITION 3 A code including the letters ‚ÄúLP‚Äù refers to packing instructions for the use of large packagings described in chapter 6.6. When a code including the letter(s) ‚ÄúP‚Äù or ‚ÄúLP‚Äù is not provided, it means that the substance is not allowed in that type of packaging. Column 9 Special packing provisions ‚Äì this column contains alpha-numeric codes which refer to the relevant special packing provisions specified in 4.1.4. The special packing provisions indicate the packagings (including large packagings). A special packing provision including the letters ‚ÄúPP‚Äù refers to a special packing provision applicable to the use of a packing instruction bearing the Code ‚ÄúP‚Äù in 4.1.4.1. A special packing provision including the letter ‚ÄúL‚Äù refers to a special packing provision applicable to a packing instruction bearing the code ‚ÄúLP‚Äù in 4.1.4.3. Column 10 IBC packing instructions ‚Äì this column contains alpha-numeric codes that refer to the relevant IBC instruction, which indicates the type of IBC that shall be used for the transport of the substance under reference. A code including the letters ‚ÄúIBC‚Äù refers to packing instructions for the use of IBCs described in chapter 6.5. When a code is not provided, it means the substance is not authorized in IBC. Column 11 IBC special provisions ‚Äì this column contains an alpha-numeric code, including the letter ‚ÄúB‚Äù, which refers to special packing provisions applicable to the use of packing instructions bearing the code ‚ÄúIBC‚Äù in 4.1.4.2. Column 12 [Reserved] Column 13 Tank and bulk container instructions ‚Äì this column contains T codes (see 4.2.5.2.6) applicable to the transport of dangerous goods in portable tanks and road tank vehicles. When a T code is not provided in this column, it means that the dangerous goods are not authorized for transport in tanks unless specifically approved by the competent authority. A code including the letters ‚ÄúBK‚Äù refers to the type of bulk containers used for the transport of bulk goods described in chapters 4.3 and 6.9. The gases authorized for transport in MEGCs are indicated in the column ‚ÄúMEGC‚Äù in tables 1 and 2 of packing instruction P200 in 4.1.4.1. Column 14 Tank special provisions ‚Äì this column contains TP notes (see 4.2.5.3) applicable to the transport of dangerous goods in portable tanks and road tank vehicles. The TP notes specified in this column apply to the portable tanks specified in column 13. Column 15 EmS ‚Äì this column refers to the relevant emergency schedules for FIRE and SPILLAGE in ‚ÄúThe EmS Guide ‚Äì Revised Emergency Response Procedures for Ships Carrying Dangerous Goods‚Äù. The first EmS code refers to the relevant Fire Schedule (e.g. Fire Schedule Alfa ‚ÄúF-A‚Äù General Fire Schedule). The second EmS code refers to the relevant Spillage Schedule (e.g. Spillage Schedule Alfa ‚ÄúS-A‚Äù Toxic Substances). Underlined EmS codes (special cases) indicate a substance, material or article for which additional advice is given in the emergency response procedures. For dangerous goods offered for transport under N.O.S. entries or other generic entries, the most relevant emergency response procedures may vary with the properties of the hazardous constituents. As a consequence, shippers may have to declare different EmS codes from those indicated, if, to their knowledge, such codes are more appropriate. The provisions in this column are not mandatory. Column 16a Stowage and handling ‚Äì this column contains the stowage and handling codes as specified in 7.1.5 and 7.1.6.

3 IMDG Code (incorporating Amendment 41-22) 197 Chapter 3.3 Special provisions applicable to certain substances, materials or articles 3.3.1 When column 6 of the Dangerous Goods List indicates that a special provision is relevant to a dangerous good, the meaning and requirement(s) of that special provision are as set out below. Where a special provision includes a requirement for package marking, the provisions of 5.2.1.2.1 to .4 shall be met. If the required mark is in the form of specific wording indicated in quotation marks, such as ‚ÄúLITHIUM BATTERIES FOR DISPOSAL‚Äù, the size of the mark shall be at least 12 mm, unless otherwise indicated in the special provision or elsewhere in this Code. 16 Samples of new or existing explosive substances or articles may be transported as directed by the competent authority for purposes including: testing, classification, research and development, quality control, or as a commercial sample. Explosive samples which are not wetted or desensitized shall be limited to 10 kg in small packages as specified by the competent authority. Explosive samples which are wetted or desensitized shall be limited to 25 kg. 23 Even though this substance has a flammability hazard, it only exhibits such hazard under extreme fire conditions in confined areas. 26 This substance is not permitted for transport in portable tanks, or intermediate bulk containers with a capacity exceeding 450 L, due to the potential initiation of an explosion when transported in large volumes. 28 This substance may be transported under the provisions of class 4.1 only if it is so packaged that the percentage of diluent will not fall below that stated, at any time during transport (see 2.4.2.4). 29 The packages, including bales, are exempt from labelling provided that they are marked with the appropriate class (e.g. ‚Äúclass 4.2‚Äù). 32 When in any other form, this substance is not subject to the provisions of this Code. 37 When coated, this substance is not subject to the provisions of this Code. 38 This substance, when it contains not more than 0.1% calcium carbide, is not subject to the provisions of this Code. 39 This substance, when it contains less than 30% or not less than 90% silicon, is not subject to the provisions of this Code. 43 When offered for transport as pesticides, these substances shall be transported under the relevant pesticide entry and in accordance with the relevant pesticide provisions (see 2.6.2.3 and 2.6.2.4). 45 Antimony sulphides and oxides which contain not more than 0.5% of arsenic, calculated on the total mass, are not subject to the provisions of this Code. 47 Ferricyanides and ferrocyanides are not subject to the provisions of this Code. 59 These substances, when they contain not more than 50% magnesium, are not subject to the provisions of this Code. 61 The technical name, which shall supplement the proper shipping name, shall be the ISO common name, or other name listed in The WHO Recommended Classification of Pesticides by Hazard and Guidelines to Classification or the name of the active substance (see also 3.1.2.8.1.1). 62 This substance, when it contains not more than 4% sodium hydroxide, is not subject to the provisions of this Code. 63 The division of class 2 and the subsidiary hazards depend on the nature of the contents of the aerosol dispenser. The following provisions shall apply: .1 Class 2.1 applies if the contents include 85% by mass or more flammable components and the chemical heat of combustion is 30 kJ/g or more; .2 Class 2.2 applies if the contents contain 1% by mass or less flammable components and the heat of combustion is less than 20 kJ/g.

Appendices 256 IMDG Code (Amendment 41-22) 2022 EDITION APPENDIX B Explosive, deflagrating A substance, e.g. propellant, which reacts by deflagration rather than detonation when ignited and used in its normal manner. Explosive, detonating A substance which reacts by detonation rather than deflagration when initiated and used in its normal manner. Explosive, extremely insensitive substance (EIS) A substance which has demonstrated through tests that it is so insensitive that there is very little probability of accidental initiation. Explosive, primary Explosive substance manufactured with a view to producing a practical effect by explosion which is very sensitive to heat, impact or friction and which, even in very small quantities, either detonates or burns very rapidly. It is able to transmit detonation (in the case of initiating explosive) or deflagration to secondary explosives close to it. The main primary explosives are mercury fulminate, lead azide and lead styphnate. Explosive, secondary Explosive substance which is relatively insensitive (when compared to primary explosives), which is usually initiated by primary explosives with or without the aid of boosters or supplementary charges. Such an explosive may react as a deflagrating or as a detonating explosive. FIREWORKS Pyrotechnic articles designed for entertainment.

The term includes: FUZES, DETONATING; FUZES, DETONATING with protective features; FUZES, IGNITING. IMDG Code Vol. 2 Applicable from: 2024-01-01/2023-01-01 on a voluntary basis

Appendix B ‚Äì Glossary of terms 257 IMDG Code (Amendment 41-22) 2022 EDITION APPENDIX B GRENADES, hand or rifle Articles which are designed to be thrown by hand or to be projected by a rifle. The term includes: GRENADES, hand or rifle, with bursting charge; GRENADES, PRACTICE, hand or rifle. The term excludes grenades, smoke which are listed under AMMUNITION, SMOKE. IGNITERS Articles containing one or more explosive substances used to start deflagration in an explosive train. They may be actuated chemically, electrically or mechanically. This term excludes the following articles which are listed separately: CORD, IGNITER; FUSE, IGNITER; FUSE, NON-DETONATING; FUZES, IGNITING; LIGHTERS, FUSE; PRIMERS, CAP TYPE; PRIMERS, TUBULAR. Ignition, means of A general term used in connection with the method employed to ignite a deflagrating train of explosive or pyrotechnic substances (for example: a primer for a propelling charge; an igniter for a rocket motor; an igniting fuze). Initiation, means of .1 A device intended to cause the detonation of an explosive (for example: detonator; detonator for ammunition; detonating fuze). .2 The term ‚Äúwith its own means of initiation‚Äù means that the contrivance has its normal initiating device assembled to it and this device is considered to present a significant risk during transport but not one great enough to be unacceptable. The term does not apply, however, to a contrivance packed together with its means of initiation provided the device is packaged so as to eliminate the risk of causing detonation of the contrivance in the event of accidental functioning of the initiating device. The means of initiating can even be assembled to the contrivance provided there are protective features such that the device is very unlikely to cause detonation of the contrivance in conditions which are associated with transport. .3 For the purposes of classification any means of initiation without two effective protective features shall be regarded as compatibility group B; an article with its own means of initiation, without two effective protective features, would be compatibility group F. On the other hand a means of initiation which itself possesses two effective protective features would be compatibility group D; and an article with a means of initiation which possesses two effective protective features would be compatibility group D or E. Means of initiation adjudged as having two effective protective features shall have been approved by the competent national authority. A common and effective way of achieving the necessary degree of protection is to use a means of initiation which incorporates two or more independent safety features. JET PERFORATING GUNS, CHARGED, oil well, without detonator Articles consisting of a steel tube or metallic strip, into which are inserted shaped charges connected by detonating cord, without means of initiation.

They are designed to be operated by the passage of ships, vehicles or personnel. The term includes ‚ÄúBangalore torpedoes‚Äù. OXYGEN GENERATORS, CHEMICAL Oxygen generators, chemical, are devices containing chemicals which upon activation release oxygen as a product of chemical reaction. Chemical oxygen generators are used for the generation of oxygen for respiratory support, e.g. in aircraft, submarines, spacecraft, bomb shelters and breathing apparatus. Oxidizing salts such as chlorates and perchlorates of lithium, sodium and potassium, which are used in chemical oxygen generators, evolve oxygen when heated. These salts are mixed (compounded) with a fuel, usually iron powder, to form a chlorate candle, which produces oxygen by continuous reaction. The fuel is used to generate heat by oxidation. Once the reaction begins, oxygen is released from the hot salt by thermal decomposition (a thermal shield is used around the generator). A portion of the oxygen reacts with the fuel to produce more heat which produces more oxygen, and so on. Initiation of the reaction can be achieved by a percussion device, friction device or electric wire. POWDER CAKE (POWDER PASTE), WETTED Substance consisting of nitrocellulose impregnated with not more than 60% of nitroglycerin or other liquid organic nitrates or a mixture of these.
