Preamble The primary aim of the International Maritime Solid Bulk Cargoes Code (IMSBC Code), which replaces the Code of Safe Practice for Solid Bulk Cargoes (BC Code), is to facilitate the safe stowage and shipment of solid bulk cargoes by providing information on the dangers associated with the shipment of certain types of solid bulk cargoes and instructions on the procedures to be adopted when the shipment of solid bulk cargoes is contemplated. The IMSBC Code, adopted on 4 December 2008 by resolution MSC.268(85), entered into force on 1 January 2011, from which date it was made mandatory under the provisions of the SOLAS Convention. The Code has been amended by resolutions adopted by the Maritime Safety Committee, the most recent being resolution MSC.500(105), incorporating Amendment 06-21, which may be applied from 1 January 2023 on a voluntary basis, and has an official entry into force on 1 December 2023. In order to keep pace with the expansion and progress of industry, the IMSBC Code, as amended, includes: ‚Ä¢ Modifications to various existing individual schedules for solid bulk cargoes. ‚Ä¢ New individual schedules for such cargoes as ammonium nitrate based fertilizer, ammonium nitrate based fertilizer MHB, clam shell, leach residue containing lead and superphosphate (triple, granular). ‚Ä¢ New definitions (including an updated definition for group A cargoes), references and requirements for cargoes which may undergo dynamic separation. This publication presents additional information to supplement the IMSBC Code, such as the Code of Practice for the Safe Loading and Unloading of Bulk Carriers (BLU Code), the Manual on loading and unloading of solid bulk cargoes for terminal representatives (BLU Manual) and recommendations on the safe use of pesticides in ships applicable to the fumigation of cargo holds. It also includes a directory of contact names and addresses of offices of designated national competent authorities responsible for the safe carriage of grain and solid bulk cargoes. The IMSBC Code and supplement is commended to Administrations, shipowners, shippers and masters and all others concerned with the standards to be applied in the safe stowage and shipment of solid bulk cargoes, excluding grain.

Foreword The International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea, 1974 (SOLAS Convention), as amended, deals with various aspects of maritime safety and contains, in parts A and B of chapter VI and part A-1 of chapter VII, the mandatory provisions governing the carriage of solid bulk cargoes and the carriage of dangerous goods in solid form in bulk, respectively. These provisions are amplified in the International Maritime Solid Bulk Cargoes Code (IMSBC Code). Detailed fire protection arrangements for ships carrying solid bulk cargoes are incorporated into chapter 11-2 of the SOLAS Convention by regulations 10 and 19. Attention is drawn to regulation 11-2/19.4 of the SOLAS Convention as amended. This provides for an appropriate document as evidence of compliance of construction and equipment with the requirements of regulation 11-2/19 to be issued to ships constructed on or after 1 July 2002 and carrying dangerous goods in solid form in bulk as defined in regulation Vll/7 of the Convention, except class 6.2 and class 7. For: cargo ships of 500 gross tonnage or over constructed on or after 1 September 1984 but before 1 July 2002; or cargo ships of less than 500 gross tonnage constructed on or after 1 February 1992 but before 1 July 2002, the requirements of regulation 11-2/19 of SOLAS, 1974, as amended by resolutions MSC.1(XLV), MSC.6(48), MSC.13(57), MSC.22(59), MSC.24(60), MSC.27(61), MSC.31(63) and MSC.57(67), apply (see SOLAS regulation 11-2/1.2). For cargo ships of less than 500 gross tonnage constructed on or after 1 September 1984 and before 1 February 1992, it is recommended that Contracting Parties extend such application to these cargo ships as far as possible. The problems involved in the carriage of bulk cargoes were recognized by the delegatesto the 1960 International Conference on Safety of Life at Sea, but at that time it was not possible to frame detailed requirements, except for the carriage of grain. The Conference did recommend, however, in paragraph 55 of Annex D to the Convention, that an internationally acceptable code of safe practice for the shipment of bulk cargoes should be drawn up under the sponsorship of the International Maritime Organization (IMO). This work was undertaken by the Organization's Sub-Committee on Containers and Cargoes and several editions of the Code of Safe Practice for Solid Bulk Cargoes (BC Code) have been published, since the first edition in 1965. The Sub-Committee was expanded to include dangerous goods and is now called the Sub-Committee on Dangerous Goods, Solid Cargoes and Containers (DSC Sub-Committee).* The prime hazards associated with the shipment of solid bulk cargoes are those relating to structural damage due to improper cargo distribution, loss or reduction of stability during a voyage and chemical reactions of cargoes. Therefore the primary aim of this Code is to facilitate the safe stowage and shipment of solid bulk cargoes by providing information on the dangers associated with the shipment of certain types of solid bulk cargoes and instructions on the procedures to be adopted when the shipment of solid bulk cargoes is contemplated. The requirements for the transport of grain are covered by the International Code for the Safe Carriage of Crain in Bulk (International Grain Code, 1991). * From 1 January 2014, the DSC Sub-Committee was replaced by the Sub-Committee on Carriage of Cargoes and Containers (CCC Sub-Committee). IMSBC CODE (Amendment 06-21) and supplement 2022 EDITION 5

Foreword The IMSBC Code that was adopted by resolution MSC.268(85)* was for adoption and implementation of Governments or for use as the basis for national regulations in pursuance of their obligations under regulation of the SOLAS Convention, as amended. The Code is mandatory under the provision of the SOLAS Convention from 1 January 2011. However, some parts of the Code continue to be recommendatory or informative. It needs to be emphasized that, in the context of the language of the Code: the words "shall", "should" and "may", when used in the Code, mean that the relevant provisions are "mandatory", "recommendatory" and "optional", respectively. Observance of the Code harmonizes the practices and procedures to be followed and the appropriate precautions to be taken in the loading, trimming, carriage and discharge of solid bulk cargoes when transported by sea, ensuring compliance with the mandatory provisions of the SOLAS Convention. The Code has undergone many changes, both in layout and content, in order to keep pace with the expansion and progress of industry. The Maritime Safety Committee (MSC) is authorized by the Organization's Assembly to adopt amendments to the Code, thus enabling IMO to respond promptly to developments in transport.

Section 1 General provisions 1.1 Introductory note It should be noted that other international and national regulations exist and that those regulations may recognize all or part of the provisions of this Code. In addition, port authorities and other bodies and organizations should recognize the Code and may use it as a basis for their storage and handling bye-laws within loading and discharge areas. 1.2 Cargoes listed in this Code 1.2.1 Typical cargoes currently shipped in bulk, together with advice on their properties and methods of handling, are given in the schedules for individual cargoes. However, these schedules are not exhaustive and the properties attributed to the cargoes are given only for guidance. Consequently, before loading, it is essential to obtain current valid information from the shipper on the physical and chemical properties of the cargoes presented for shipment. The shipper shall provide appropriate information about the cargo to be shipped (see 4.2). 1.2.2 Where a solid bulk cargo is specifically listed in appendix 1 to this Code (individual schedules for solid bulk cargoes), it shall be transported in accordance with the provisions in its schedule in addition to the provisions in sections 1 to 10 and 11.1.1 of this Code. The master shall consider whether to consult the authorities at the ports of loading and discharge, as necessary, concerning the requirements which may be in force and applicable for the carriage. 1.3 Cargoes not listed in this Code 1.3.1 If a solid cargo which is not listed in appendix 1 to this Code is proposed for carriage in bulk, the shipper shall, prior to loading, provide the competent authority of the port of loading with the characteristics and properties of the cargo in accordance with section 4 of this Code. Based on the information received, the competent authority will assess the acceptability of the cargo for safe shipment. 1.3.1.1 When it is assessed that the solid bulk cargo proposed for carriage may present hazards as those defined by group A or B of this Code as defined in 1.7, advice is to be sought from the competent authorities of the port of unloading and of the flag State. The three competent authorities will set the preliminary suitable conditions for the carriage of this cargo. 1.3.1.2 When it is assessed that the solid bulk cargo proposed for carriage presents no specific hazards for transportation, the carriage of this cargo shall be authorized. The competent authorities of the port of unloading and of the flag State shall be advised of that authorization. 1.3.2 The competent authority of the port of loading shall provide to the master a certificate stating the characteristics of the cargo and the required conditions for carriage and handling of this shipment. The competent authority of the port of loading shall also submit an application to the Organization, within one year from the issue of the certificate, to incorporate this solid bulk cargo into appendix 1 of this Code. The format of this application shall be as outlined in 1.3.3. IMSBC CODE (Amendment 06-21) and supplement 2022 EDITION 9

Section 2 General loading, carriage and unloading precautions 2.1 Cargo distribution 2.1.1 General A number of accidents have occurred as a result of improper loading and unloading of solid bulk cargoes. It shall be noted that solid bulk cargoes have to be properly distributed throughout the ship to provide adequate stability and to ensure that the ship's structure is never overstressed. Furthermore, the shipper shall provide the master with adequate information about the cargo, as specified in section 4, to ensure that the ship is properly loaded.* 2.1.2 To prevent the structure being overstressed A general cargo ship is normally constructed to carry cargoes in the range of 1.39 to 1.67 cubic metres per tonne when loaded to full bale and deadweight capacities. When loading a high-density solid bulk cargo, particular attention shall be given to the distribution of weights to avoid excessive stresses, taking into account that the loading conditions may be different from those found normally and that improper distribution of such cargo may be capable of stressing either the structure under the load or the entire hull. To set out exact rules for the distribution of loading is not practicable for all ships because the structural arrangements of each vessel may vary greatly. The information on proper distribution of cargo may be provided in the ship's stability information booklet or may be obtained by the use of loading calculators, if available. 2.1.3 To aid stability 2.1.3.1 Having regard to SOLAS regulation 11-1/5-1, a stability information booklet shall be provided aboard all ships subject to the Convention. The master shall be able to calculate the stability for the anticipated worst conditions during the voyage, as well as that on departure, and demonstrate that the stability is adequate. 2.1.3.2 Shifting divisions and bins, of adequate strength, shall be erected whenever solid bulk cargoes, which are suspected of readily shifting, are carried in 'tween deck cargo spaces or in only partially filled cargo spaces. 2.1.3.3 As far as practicable, high-density cargoes shall be loaded in the lower hold cargo spaces in preference to 'tween deck cargo spaces. 2.1.3.4 When it is necessary to carry high-density cargoes in 'tween decks or higher cargo spaces, due consideration shall be given to ensure that the deck area is not overstressed and that the ship's stability is not reduced below the minimum acceptable level specified in the ship's stability data. 2.2 Loading and unloading 2.2.1 Cargo spaces shall be inspected and prepared for the particular cargo which is to be loaded.t * Also refer to the Code of Practice for the Safe Loading and Unloading of Bulk Carriers (resolution A.862(20), as amended) (see the supplement of this publication). t Refer to Guidance to ships' crews and terminal personnel for bulk carrier inspections (resolution A.866(20)).

Section 3 Safety of personnel and ship 3.1 General requirements 3.1.1 Prior to and during loading, carriage and discharge of a solid bulk cargo, all necessary safety precautions shall be observed. 3.1.2 Routine onboard operational fire safety risk assessments shall be carried out by the ship's crew for cargo handling areas on self-unloading bulk carriers featuring internally installed conveyor systems within the ship's structure. Due consideration shall be given to fire prevention and the effective operation of fire detection systems, containment and suppression under all anticipated operating conditions and cargoes. The fire safety risk assessments shall be detailed in the ship's Safety Management System (SMS) together with a recommended timing to provide regular assessments. 3.1.3 A copy of the instructions on emergency response and medical first aid* relevant to incidents involving dangerous goods in solid form in bulk shall be on board. 3.2 Poisoning, corrosive and asphyxiation hazards 3.2.1 Some solid bulk cargoes are susceptible to oxidation, which may result in oxygen depletion, emission of toxic gases or fumes and self-heating. Some cargoes are not liable to oxidize but may emit toxic fumes, particularly when wet. There are also cargoes which, when wetted, are corrosive to skin, eyes and mucous membranes or to the ship's structure. When these cargoes are carried, particular attention shall be given to protection of personnel and the need for special precautions to be taken prior to loading and after unloading. 3.2.2 Appropriate attention shall be given that cargo spaces and adjacent spaces may be depleted in oxygen or may contain toxic or asphyxiating gases, and that an empty cargo space or tank which has remained closed for some time may have insufficient oxygen to support life. 3.2.3 Many solid bulk cargoes are liable to cause oxygen depletion in a cargo space or tank. These include, but are not limited to, most vegetable products and forest products, ferrous metals, metal sulphide concentrates and coal cargoes. 3.2.4 Prior to entry into an enclosed space aboard a ship, appropriate procedures shall be followed, taking into account the recommendations developed by the Organization.t It is to be noted that, after a cargo space or tank has been tested and generally found to be safe for entry, small areas may exist where oxygen is deficient or toxic fumes are still present. 3.2.5 When carrying a solid bulk cargo that is liable to emit a toxic or flammable gas, and/or cause oxygen depletion in the cargo space, the appropriate instrument(s) for measuring the concentration of gas and oxygen in the cargo space shall be provided. 3.2.6 Emergency entry into a cargo space shall be undertaken only by trained personnel wearing self-contained breathing apparatus and protective clothing and always under the supervision of a responsible officer. * Refer to Medical First Aid Guide for Use in Accidents Involving Dangerous Goods (MFAG) (MSC/Circ.857) (see the IMDG Code Supplement). t Refer to Revised recommendations for entering enclosed spaces aboard ships (A.1050(27)) (see the supplement of this publication).

Section 3 3.3 Health hazards due to dust To minimize the chronic and acute risks associated with exposure to the dust of some solid bulk cargoes, the need for a high standard of personal hygiene of those exposed to the dust cannot be overemphasized. Precautions, including the use of appropriate breathing protection, protective clothing, protective skin creams, adequate personal washing and laundering of outer clothing, shall be taken, as necessary. 3.4 Flammable atmosphere 3.4.1 Dust of some soli_p bulk cargoes may constitute an explosion hazard, especially while loading, unloading and cleaning. This risk can be minimized by ventilating to prevent the formation of a dust-laden atmosphere and by hosing down rather than sweeping. 3.4.2 Some cargoes may emit flammable gases in sufficient quantities to constitute a fire or explosion hazard. Where this is indicated in the cargo schedule in this Code or by the cargo information provided by the shipper, the cargo spaces shall be effectively ventilated, as necessary. The atmosphere in the cargo spaces shall be monitored by means of an appropriate gas detector. Due consideration shall be given to the ventilation and monitoring of the atmosphere in the enclosed spaces adjacent to the cargo spaces. 3.5 Ventilation 3.5.1 Unless expressly provided otherwise, when cargoes which may emit toxic gases are carried, the cargo spaces shall be provided with mechanical or natural ventilation; and, when cargoes which may emit flammable gases are carried, the cargo spaces shall be provided with mechanical ventilation. 3.5.2 If maintaining ventilation would endanger the ship or the cargo, it may be interrupted unless this would produce a risk of explosion. 3.5.3 When continuous ventilation is required by the schedule for the cargo in this Code or by the cargo information provided by the shipper, ventilation shall be maintained while the cargo is on board, unless a situation develops where ventilation would endanger the ship. 3.5.4 Ventilation openings shall be provided in holds intended for the carriage of cargoes that require continuous ventilation. Such openings shall comply with the requirements of the Load Line Convention, as amended, for openings not fitted with means of closure. 3.5.5 Ventilation shall be such that any escaping hazardous gases, vapours or dust cannot enter the accommodation or other interior spaces in hazardous concentrations. Due consideration shall be given to prevent escaping hazardous gases, vapours or dust from reaching enclosed work areas.

The shipper shall provide the ship's master or his representative with the appropriate certificates of test, if required in this Code. 4.3.2 When a group A cargo is carried, the shipper shall provide the ship's master or his representative with a signed certificate of the TML, and a signed certificate or declaration of the moisture content, each issued by an entity recognized by the competent authority of the port of loading. The certificate of TML shall contain, or be accompanied by, the result of the test for determining the TML. The declaration of moisture content shall contain, or be accompanied by, a statement by the shipper that the moisture content is, to the best of his knowledge and belief, the average moisture content of the cargo at the time the declaration is presented to the master. 4.3.3 When a group A cargo is carried, procedures for sampling, testing and controlling moisture content to ensure the moisture content is less than the TML when it is on board the ship shall be established by the shipper, taking account of the provisions of this Code. Such procedures shall be approved and their implementation checked by the competent authority of the port of loading.* The document issued by the competent authority stating that the procedures have been approved shall be provided to the master or his representative. 4.3.4 If the cargo is loaded on to the ship from barges, in developing the procedures under 4.3.3 the shipper shall include procedures to protect the cargo on the barges from any precipitation and water ingress. 4.3.5 When a group A cargo is to be loaded into more than one cargo space of a ship, the certificate or the declaration of moisture content shall certify the moisture content of each type of finely grained material loaded into each cargo space. Notwithstanding this requirement, if sampling according to internationally or nationally accepted standard procedures indicates that the moisture content is uniform throughout the consignment, then one certificate or declaration of average moisture content for all cargo spaces is acceptable. ‚Ä¢ Refer to Guidelines for developing and approving procedures for sampling, testing and controlling the moisture content for solid bulk cargoes which may liquefy (MSC.1/Circ.1454/Rev.1) (see the supplement of this publication). 28 IMSBC CODE (Amendment 06-21) and supplement 2022 EDITION

Assessment of acceptability of consignmentsfor safe shipment 4.3.6 Where certification is required by the individual schedules for cargoes possessingchemical hazards, the certificate shall contain, or be accompanied by, a statement from the shipper that the chemical characteristics of the cargo are, to the best of his knowledge, those present at the time of the ship's loading. However, it is important to ensure that the samples taken are representative of the whole depth of the stockpile. 4.4 Sampling procedures 4.4.1 Physical property tests on the consignment are meaningless unless they are conducted prior to loading on truly representative test samples. 4.4.2 Sampling shall be conducted only by persons who have been suitably trained in sampling procedures and who are under the supervision of someone who is fully aware of the properties of the consignment and also the applicable principles and practices of sampling. 4.4.3 For a group A cargo, the shipper shall facilitate access to stockpiles for the purpose of inspection, sampling and subsequent testing by the ship's nominated representative. 4.4.4 Prior to taking samples, and within the limits of practicability, a visual inspection of the consignment which is to form the ship's cargo shall be carried out. Any substantial portions of material which appear to be contaminated or significantly different in characteristics or moisture content from the bulk of the consignment shall be sampled and analysed separately. Depending upon the results obtained in these tests, it may be necessary to reject those particular portions as unfit for shipment. 4.4.5 Representative samples shall be obtained by employing techniques which take the following factors into account: .1 the type of material; .2 the particle size distribution; .3 composition of the material and its variability; .4 the manner in which the material is stored, in stockpiles, rail wagons or other containers, and transferred or loaded by material-handling systems such as conveyors, loading chutes, crane grabs, etc.; .5 the chemical hazards (toxicity, corrosivity, etc.); .6 the characteristics which have to be determined: moisture content, TML, bulk density/stowage factor, angle of repose, etc.; .7 variations in moisture distribution throughout the consignment which may occur due to weather conditions, natural drainage, e.g. to lower levels of stockpiles or containers, or other forms of moisture migration; and .8 variations which may occur following freezing of the material. 4.4.6 Throughout the sampling procedures, utmost care shall be taken to prevent changes in quality and characteristics. Samples for moisture testing shall be immediately placed in suitable airtight, non-absorbent containers with a minimum of free air space to minimize any change in moisture content, such containers being properly marked. 4.4.7 Unless expressly provided otherwise, sampling for the test required by this Code shall follow an internationally or nationally accepted standard procedure. 4.4.8 For unprocessed mineral ores, the sampling of stationary stockpiles shall be carried out only when access to the full depth of the stockpile is available and samples from the full depth of the stockpile can be extracted.

Section 4 4.5 Interval between sampling/testing and loading for TML and moisture content determination 4.5.1 The shipper shall be responsible for ensuring that a test to determine the TML of a solid bulk cargo is conducted within six months to the date of loading the cargo. Notwithstanding this provision, where the composition or characteristics of the cargo are variable for any reason, the shipper shall be responsible for ensuring that a test to determine the TML is conducted again after it is reasonably assumed that such variation has taken place. 4.5.2 The shipper shall be responsible for ensuring that sampling and testing for moisture content is conducted as nec!,r as practicable to the date of commencement of loading. The interval between sampling/testing and the date of commencement of loading shall never be more than 7 days. If the cargo has been exposed to significant rain or snow between the time of testing and the date of completion of loading, the shipper shall be responsible for ensuring that the moisture content of the cargo is still less than its TML, and evidence of this is provided to the master as soon as practicable. 4.5.3 Samples of frozen cargo shall be tested for the TML or the moisture content after the free moisture has completely thawed. 4.6 Sampling proceduresfor concentrate stockpiles 4.6.1 It is not practicable to specify a single method of sampling for all consignments since the character of the material and the form in which it is available will affect the selection of the procedure to be used. In the absence of internationally or nationally accepted standard sampling procedures, the following sampling procedures for concentrate stockpiles may be used to determine the moisture content and the TML of mineral concentrates. These procedures are not intended to replace sampling procedures, such as the use of automatic sampling, that achieve equal or superior accuracy of either moisture content or TML. 4.6.2 Subsamples are taken in a reasonably uniform pattern, where possible from a levelled stockpile. 4.6.3 A plan of the stockpile is drawn and divided into areas, each of which contains approximately 125 t, 250 t or 500 t, depending on the amount of concentrate to be shipped. Such a plan will indicate the number of subsamples required and where each is to be taken. Each subsample taken is drawn from approximately 50 cm below the surface of the designated area. 4.6.4 The number of subsamples and sample size are given by the competent authority or determined in accordance with the following scale: Consignments of not more than 75,000 t: One 200 g subsample is taken for each 125 t to be shipped. Consignments of more than 75,000 but not more than 60,000 t: One 200 g subsample is taken for each 250 t to be shipped. Consignments of more than 60,000 t: One 200 g subsample is taken for each 500 t to be shipped. 4.6.5 Subsamples for moisture content determination are placed in sealed containers (such as plastic bags, cans or small metallic drums) immediately on withdrawal for conveyance to the testing laboratory, where they are thoroughly mixed in order to obtain a fully representative sample. Where testing facilities are not available at the testing site, such mixing is done under controlled conditions at the stockpile and the representative sample placed in a sealed container and shipped to the test laboratory. 4.6.6 Basic procedural steps include: .1 identification of consignment to be sampled; 30 IMSBC CODE (Amendment 06-21) and supplement 2022 EDITION

Assessment of acceptability of consignments for safe shipment .2 determination of the number of individual subsamples and representative samples, as described in 4.6.4, which are required; .3 determination of the positions from which to obtain subsamples and the method of combining such subsamples to arrive at a representative sample; .4 gathering of individual subsamples and placing them in sealed containers; .5 thorough mixing of subsamples to obtain the representative sample; and .6 placing the representative sample in a sealed container if it has to be shipped to a test laboratory. 4.7 Examples of standardized sampling procedures, for information ISO 3082:2017 Iron ores - Sampling and sample preparation procedures (Note: Under this Standard, the in situ sampling of ships and stockpiles is not permitted) IS 1405:2010 Iron ores - Sampling and sample preparation - Manual method (Note: This Indian Standard covers the in situ sampling of stockpiles up to a height of 3 m) ISO 1988:1975 Hard coal - Sampling ASTM D2234/D2234M-17 Standard Practice for Collection of a Gross Sample of Coal Australian Standards AS 4264.1 AS 1141 - Series BS 1017-1:1989 BS 1017-2:1994 Coal and coke - Sampling: Part 1: Coal - Sampling procedures Methods for sampling and testing aggregates Sampling of coal and coke.

Section 5 Trimming procedures 5.1 General provisions for trimming 5.1.1 Trimming a cargo reduces the likelihood of the cargo shifting and minimizes the air entering the cargo. Air entering the cargo could lead to spontaneous heating. To minimize these risks, cargoes shall be trimmed reasonably level, as necessary. 5.1.2 Cargo spaces shall be as full as practicable without resulting in excessive loading on the bottom structure or 'tween deck to prevent sliding of a solid bulk cargo. Due consideration shall be given to the amount of a solid bulk cargo in each cargo space, taking into account the possibility of shifting and longitudinal moments and forces of the ship. Cargo shall be spread as widely as practicable to the boundary of the cargo space. Alternate hold loading restrictions, as required by SOLAS chapter XII, may also need to be taken into account. 5.1.3 The master has the right to require that the cargo be trimmed level, where there is any concern regarding stability based upon the information available, taking into account the characteristics of the ship and the intended voyage. 5.2 Special provisions for multi-deck ships 5.2.1 When a solid bulk cargo is loaded only in lower cargo spaces, it shall be trimmed sufficiently to equalize the mass distribution on the bottom structure. 5.2.2 When solid bulk cargoes are carried in 'tween decks, the hatchways of such 'tween decks shall be closed in those cases where the loading information indicates an unacceptable level of stress of the bottom structure if the hatchways are left open. The cargo shall be trimmed reasonably level and shall either extend from side to side or be secured by additional longitudinal divisions of sufficient strength. The safe load-carrying capacity of the 'tween decks shall be observed to ensure that the deck structure is not overloaded. 5.2.3 If coal cargoes are carried in 'tween decks, the hatchways of such 'tween decks shall be tightly sealed to prevent air moving up through the body of the cargo in the 'tween decks. 5.3 Special provisions for cohesive bulk cargoes 5.3.1 All damp cargoes and some dry ones possess cohesion. For cohesive cargoes, the general provisions in 5.1 shall apply. 5.3.2 The angle of repose is not an indicator of the stability of a cohesive bulk cargo and it is not included in the individual schedules for cohesive cargoes. 5.4 Special provisions for non-cohesivebulk cargoes 5.4.1 Non-cohesive bulk cargoes are those listed in paragraph 1 in appendix 3 and any other cargo not listed in the appendix, exhibiting the properties of a non-cohesive material. IMSBC CODE (Amendment 06-21) and supplement 2022 EDITION 33

Section 5 5.4.2 5.4.3 5.4.4 5.4.5 For trimming purposes, solid bulk cargoes can be categorized as cohesive or non-cohesive. The angle of repose is a characteristic of non-cohesive bulk cargoes which is indicative of cargo stability and has been included in the individual schedules for non-cohesive cargoes. The angle of repose of the cargoes shall establish which provisions of this section apply. Methods for determining the angle of repose are given in section 6. Non-cohesive bulk cargoes having an angle of repose less than or equal to 30¬∞ These cargoes, which flow freely like grain, shall be carried according to the provisions applicable to the stowage of grain cargoes.* The bulk density of the cargo shall be taken into account when determining: .1 the scantlings and securing arrangements of divisions and bin bulkheads; and .2 the stability effect of free cargo surfaces. Non-cohesivebulk cargoes having an angle of repose greater than 30¬∞ to 35¬∞ inclusive These cargoes shall be trimmed according to the following criteria: .1 the unevenness of the cargo surface measured as the vertical distance (b..h) between the highest and lowest levels of the cargo surface shall not exceed B/10, where B is the beam of the ship in metres, with a maximum allowable b..h = 1.5 m; or .2 loading is carried out using trimming equipment approved by the competent authority. Non-cohesive bulk cargoes having an angle of repose greater than 35¬∞ These cargoes shall be trimmed according to the following criteria: .1 the unevenness of the cargo surface measured as the vertical distance (b..h) between the highest and lowest levels of the cargo surface shall not exceed B/10, where B is the beam of the ship in metres, with a maximum allowable b..h = 2 m; or .2 loading is carried out using trimming equipment approved by the competent authority. * Reference is made to chapter VI of the SOLAS Convention, and the International Code for the Safe Carriage of Grain in Bulk (resolution MSC.23(59)). 34 IMSBC CODE (Amendment 06-21) and supplement 2022 EDITION

Section 6 Methods of determining the angle of repose 6.1 General An angle of repose of a non-cohesive solid bulk material shall be measured by a method approved by the appropriate authority as required by 4.1.4 of this Code. 6.2 Recommended test methods There are various methods in use to determine the angle of repose for non-cohesive solid bulk materials. The recommended test methods are listed below: 6.2.1 Tilting box method This laboratory test method is suitable for non-cohesive granular materials with a grain size not greater than 10 mm. A full description of the equipment and procedure is given in 2.1 of appendix 2. 6.2.2 Shipboard test method In the absence of a tilting box apparatus, an alternative procedure for determining the approximate angle of repose is given in 2.2 of appendix 2.

Section 7 Cargoes which may liquefy or undergo dynamic separation 7.1 Introduction 7.1.1 The purpose of this section is to bring to the attention of masters and others with responsibilities for the loading and carriage of bulk cargoes, the risks associated with liquefaction or dynamic separation and the precautions to minimize the risk. Such cargoes may appear to be in a relatively dry granular state when loaded, and yet may contain sufficient moisture to become fluid or unstable under the stimulus of compaction and the vibration which occurs during a voyage. 7.1.2 A ship's motion may cause a cargo to shift sufficiently to capsize the vessel. Cargo shift can be divided into two types, namely, sliding failure or liquefaction consequence. Trimming the cargo in accordance with section 5 can prevent sliding failure. 7.1.3 Some group A cargoes may also heat spontaneously. 7.2 Conditions for hazards 7.2.1 Group A cargoes contain a certain proportion of small particles and a certain amount of moisture. Group A cargoes may liquefy during a voyage even when they are cohesive and trimmed level. Liquefaction can result in cargo shift. This phenomenon may be described as follows: .1 the volume of the spaces between the particles reduces as the cargo is compacted owing to the ship's motion, etc.; .2 the reduction in space between cargo particles causes an increase in water pressure in the space; and .3 the increase in water pressure reduces the friction between cargo particles, resulting in a reduction in the shear strength of the cargo. 7.2.2 Liquefaction does not occur when the cargo consists of large particles or lumps and water passes through the spaces between the particles and there is no increase in the water pressure. 7.2.3 A cargo shift caused by liquefaction may occur when the moisture content exceeds the TML. Some cargoes are susceptible to moisture migration and may develop a dangerous wet base even if the average moisture content is less than the TML. Although the cargo surface may appear dry, undetected liquefaction may take place, resulting in shifting of the cargo. Cargoes with high moisture content are prone to sliding, particularly when the cargo is shallow and subject to large heel angles. 7.2.4 In the resulting viscous fluid state cargo may flow to one side of the ship with a roll but not completely return with a roll the other way. Consequently the ship may progressively reach a dangerous heel and capsize quite suddenly. 7.3 Provisions for cargoes which may liquefy or undergo dynamic separation 7.3.1 General 7.3.1.1 Group A cargoes shall only be accepted for loading when the actual moisture content of the cargo is less than its TML. Notwithstanding this provision, cargoes having moisture content in excess of 36 IMSBC CODE (Amendment 06-21) and supplement 2022 EDITION

Cargoes which may liquefy or undergo dynamic separation the TML may be carried on a specially constructed or fitted cargo ship for confining cargo shift specified in 7.3.2. 7.3.1.2 Notwithstanding the provisions in 1.4 of this Code, the requirements in 4.2.2.9, 4.2.2.10, 4.3.2 to 4.3.5, 4.5, 4.6 and 8 of this Code need not apply to a group A cargo provided that the cargo is carried on a specially constructed or fitted cargo ship for confining cargo shift specified in 7.3.2 or on a specially constructed ship for dry powdery cargoes specified in 7.3.3. 7.3.1.3 Cargoes which contain liquids other than packaged canned goods or the like shall not be stowed in the same cargo space above or adjacent to these solid bulk cargoes. 7.3.1.4 Adequate measures shall be taken to prevent liquids entering the cargo space in which these solid bulk cargoes are stowed during the voyage. 7.3.1.5 Masters shall be cautioned about the possible danger of using water to cool these cargoes while the ship is at sea. Introducing water may bring the moisture content of these cargoes to a flow state. When necessary, due consideration shall be given to apply water in the form of spray. 7.3.2 Specially constructed or fitted cargo ships for confining cargo shift 7.3.2.1 Specially constructed cargo ships for confining cargo shift shall have permanent structural boundaries, so arranged as to confine any shift of cargo to an acceptable limit. The ship concerned shall carry evidence of approval by the Administration. 7.3.2.2 Specially fitted cargo ships for confining cargo shift shall be fitted with specially designed portable divisions to confine any shift of cargo to an acceptable limit. Specially fitted cargo ships shall be in compliance with the following requirements: .1 The design and positioning of such special arrangements shall adequately provide not only the restraint of the immense forces generated by the flow movement of high-density bulk cargoes, but also for the need to reduce to an acceptable safe level the potential heeling movements arising out of a transverse cargo flow across the cargo space. Divisions provided to meet these requirements shall not be constructed of wood . . 2 The elements of the ship's structure bounding such cargo shall be strengthened, as necessary . .3 The plan of special arrangements and details of the stability conditions on which the design has been based shall have been approved by the Administration. The ship concerned shall carry evidence of approval by the Administration. 7.3.2.3 A submission made to an Administration for approval of such a ship shall include: .1 relevant structural drawings, including scaled longitudinal and transverse sections; .2 stability calculations, taking into account loading arrangements and possible cargo shift, showing the distribution of cargo and liquids in tanks, and of cargo which may become fluid; and .3 any other information which may assist the Administration in the assessment of the submission. 7.3.3 Specially constructed cargo ships for dry powdery cargoes 7.3.3.1 Specially constructed cargo ships for dry powdery cargoes shall be designed and constructed to: .1 carry solely dry powdery cargoes; and .2 handle cargoes by means of closed type systems using pneumatic equipment which prevent the cargo from the exposure to weather. 7.3.3.2 The ship concerned shall carry evidence of approval by the Administration.

Section 8 Test procedures for group A cargoes 8.1 General For a group A cargo, the actual moisture content and transportable moisture limit shall be determined in accordance with a procedure determined by the appropriate authority as required by 4.1.4 of this Code. 8.2 Test procedures for measurementof moisture content There are recognized international and national methods for determining moisture content for various materials. Reference is made to 1.1.4.4 of appendix 2. 8.3 Methods for determining transportable moisture limit The recommended methods for determining transportable moisture limit are given in appendix 2. 8.4 Complementary test procedure for determining the possibility of liquefaction 8.4.1 A ship's master may carry out a check test for approximately determining the possibility of flow on 8.4.2 38 board ship or at the dockside by the following auxiliary method: Half fill a cylindrical can or similar container (0.5 to 1 L capacity) with a sample of the material. Take the can in one hand and bring it down sharply to strike a hard surface such as a solid table from a height of about 0.2 m. Repeat the procedure 25 times at one- or two-second intervals. Examine the surface for free moisture or fluid conditions. If free moisture or a fluid condition appears, arrangements should be made to have additional laboratory tests conducted on the material before it is accepted for loading. If samples remain dry following a can test, the moisture content of the material may still exceed the transportable moisture limit (TML). IMSBC CODE (Amendment 06-21) and supplement 2022 EDITION

Section 9 Materials possessingchemical hazards 9.1 General Solid bulk cargoes which may possess chemical hazards during transport, because of their chemical nature or properties, are in group B. These materials can be classified as follows: .1 dangerous goods (see 9.2.2), not possessingadditional chemical hazards specified in 9.2.3; .2 MHB (see 9.2.3); or .3 dangerous goods also possessingadditional chemical hazards specified in 9.2.3. It is essential to obtain current, valid information about the physical and chemical properties of the cargoes to be shipped in bulk, prior to loading. 9.2 Hazard classification 9.2.1 The classification of materials possessing chemical hazards and intended to be shipped in bulk under the requirements of this Code shall be in accordance with 9.2.2 and 9.2.3. 9.2.2 Classification of dangerous goods SOLAS regulation Vll/7 defines dangerous goods in solid form in bulk. For the purpose of this Code, dangerous goods shall be classified in accordance with part 2 of the IMDG Code. 9.2.2.1 Class 4.1: Flammable solids The materials in this class are readily combustible solids and solids which may cause fire through friction. 9.2.2.2 Class 4.2: Substances liable to spontaneous combustion The materials in this class are materials, other than pyrophoric materials, which, in contact with air without energy supply, are liable to self-heating. 9.2.2.3 Class 4.3: Substances which, in contact with wate~ emit flammable gases The materials in this class are solids which, by interaction with water, are liable to become spontaneously flammable or to give off flammable gases in dangerous quantities. 9.2.2.4 Class 5.1: Oxidizing substances The materials in this class are materials that, while in themselves not necessarily combustible, may, generally by yielding oxygen, cause, or contribute to, the combustion of other material. 9.2.2.5 Class 6.1: Toxic substances The materials in this class are materials liable either to cause death or serious injury or to harm human health if swallowed or inhaled, or by skin contact.

Section 9 9.2.2.6 Class 7: Radioactive material The materials in this class are any materials containing radionuclides where both the activity concentration and the total activity in the consignment exceed the values specified in 2.7.2.2.1 to 2.7.2.2.6 of the IMDG Code. 9.2.2.7 Class 8: Corrosive substances The materials in this class are materials which, by chemical action, will cause severe damage when in contact with living tissue or will materially damage, or even destroy, other goods or the means of transport. 9.2.2.8 Class 9: Miscellaneous dangerous substances and articles The materials in this class are materials and articles which, during transport, present a danger not covered by other classes. 9.2.3 Materials hazardous only in bulk (MHB) 9.2.3.1 General 9.2.3.1.1 These are materials which, when carried in bulk, possess chemical hazards other than the hazards covered by the classification system of the IMDG Code. These materials present a significant risk when carried in bulk and require special precautions. 9.2.3.1.2 A material shall be classified as MHB if the material possesses one or more of the chemical hazards (excluding those hazards which are covered by the classification system of the IMDG Code) as defined below. When a test method is prescribed, representative samples of the cargo to be carried shall be used for testing. Samples shall be taken 200 mm to 360 mm inward from the surface at 3 m intervals over the length of a stockpile. 9.2.3.1.3 A material may also be classified as MHB by analogy with similar cargoes with known hazardous properties or by records of accidents. 9.2.3.1.4 Although the chemical hazards are intended to be closely defined in order to establish a uniform approach to MHB classification, where human experience or other factors indicate the need to consider other chemical hazards, these shall always be taken into account. Where deviations from the chemical hazards described in 9.2.3.2 to 9.2.3.7 have been recognized (Other hazards (OH)), they shall be properly recorded with justifications. Other hazards are to be included in the section for "Hazard" in the individual schedule. 9.2.3.1.5 A notational reference shall be provided in the "MHB" cell of the Characteristics table for each individual schedule for cargoes classified as MHB. When a material possesses one or more of the chemical hazards as defined below, the notational reference for each hazard shall be included in the "MHB" cell.

An acceptable test is prescribed in the United Nations Manual of Tests and Criteria, part Ill, section 37. A representative sample of the cargo shall be tested at typical as-shipped cargo conditions, including moisture content by mass, bulk density, particle size distribution and atmospheric conditions. The assessment of localized corrosion occurring upon the steel surface shall be performed using national or international standards. The test shall be conducted taking into account the guidance developed by the Organization.* 9.3 Stowage and segregation requirements 9.3.1 General requirements 9.3.1.1 The potential hazards of the cargoes in group B and falling within the classification of 9.2.2 and 9.2.3 entail the need for segregation of incompatible cargoes. Segregation shall also take account of any identified subsidiary hazard. 9.3.1.2 In addition to general segregation as between whole classes of materials, there may be a need to segregate a particular material from others. In the case of segregation from combustible materials, this shall be understood not to include packaging material, ceiling or dunnage; the latter shall, in these circumstances, be kept to a minimum. 9.3.1.3 For the purpose of segregating incompatible materials, the words "hold" and "compartment" are deemed to mean a cargo space enclosed by steel bulkheads or shell plating and by steel decks. The boundaries of such a space shall be resistant to fire and liquid. * Refer to Guidance for conducting the refined MHB (CR) test (MSC.1/Circ.1600/Rev.1).

Section 11 Security provisions Introductory note The provisions of this section address the security of bulk cargoes in transport by sea. It should be borne in mind that some substances shipped as bulk cargo may, through their intrinsic nature, or when shipped in combination with other substances, be used as constituents for, or enhance the effect of, weapons used in the commission of unlawful acts. (It should also be borne in mind that ships used to carry bulk cargoes may also be used as a means to transport unauthorized weapons, incendiary devices or explosives, irrespective of the nature of the cargo carried.) National competent authorities may apply additional security provisions, which should be considered when offering or transporting bulk cargoes. The provisions of this section remain recommendatory except 11.1.1. 11.1 11.1.1 11.1.2 11.1.3 11.1.4 11.1.5 11.2 11.2.1 General provisions for companies, ships and port facilities The relevant provisions of chapter Xl-2 of SOLAS 74, as amended, and of part A of the ISPS Code shall apply to companies, ships and port facilities both engaged in the handling and transport of solid bulk cargoes and to which chapter Xl-2 of SOLAS 74, as amended, applies, taking into account the guidance given in part B of the ISPS Code. Due consideration should be given to the security-related provisions of the ILO/IMO Code of Practice on Security in Ports and the IMDG Code, as appropriate. Any shore-based company personnel, ship-based personnel and port facility personnel engaged in the handling and transport of bulk cargoes should be aware of any security requirements for such cargoes, in addition to those specified in the ISPS Code, and commensurate with their responsibilities. The training of the company security officer, shore-based company personnel having specific security duties, port facility security officer and port facility personnel having specific duties, engaged in the handling and transport of bulk cargoes, should also include elements of security awareness related to the nature of those cargoes, for example where such cargoes are materials hazardous only in bulk. All shipboard personnel and port facility personnel who are not mentioned in 11.1.4 and are engaged in the transport of bulk cargoes should be familiar with the provisions of the relevant security plans related to those cargoes, commensurate with their responsibilities. General provisions for shore-side personnel For the purpose of this subsection, shore-side personnel covers individuals such as those who: prepare transport documents for bulk cargoes; offer bulk cargoes for transport; accept bulk cargoes for transport; handle bulk cargoes; IMSBC CODE (Amendment 06-21) and supplement 2022 EDITION 51

Individual schedules of solid bulk cargoes BROWN COAL BRIQUETTES (appendix, continued) 5 This cargo shall not be stowed adjacent to hot areas.* Note: For interpretation of these terms, see section 9. Loading 1 Prior to loading, the shipper, or their appointed agent, shall provide in writing to the master the characteristics of the cargo and the recommended safe handling procedures for loading and transport of the cargo. As a minimum, the cargo's contract specifications for moisture content, sulphur content and size shall be stated. 2 This cargo shall be stored for 7 days prior to loading. This substantially reduces the risk of spontaneous combustion in subsequent transport, storage and handling. 3 Before loading this cargo, the master shall ensure the following: .1 weather deck enclosures to the cargo space have been inspected to ensure their integrity. Such closures are closed and sealed; .2 all electrical cables and components situated in cargo spaces and adjacent enclosed spaces are free from defects. Such cables and electrical components are safe to be used in a flammable and/or dusty atmosphere or positively isolated. The provisions of this clause need not apply to engine-rooms where the engine-room is separated from the cargo space by a gastight bulkhead with no direct access. 4 Smoking and the use of naked flames shall not be permitted in the cargo areas and adjacent spaces and appropriate warning notices shall be posted in conspicuous places. Burning, cutting, chipping, welding or other sources of ignition shall not be permitted in the vicinity of cargo spaces or in other adjacent spaces. 5 This cargo shall not be dropped more than one metre during loading, to minimize the production of dust and fines. 6 Individual cargo spaces shall be loaded without interruption, where possible. Hot spots may develop in a cargo space that has been kept open for more than 6 days (or less in weather over 30¬∞(). 7 Prior to departure, the master shall be satisfied that the surface of the material has been trimmed reasonably level to the boundaries of the cargo space to avoid the formation of gas pockets and to prevent air from permeating the body of the briquettes. Casing leading into the cargo space shall be adequately sealed. The shipper shall ensure that the master receives the necessary cooperation from the loading terminal. 8 Individual cargo spaces shall be closed and sealed as soon as practicable after the cargo has been loaded into each cargo space. Precautions 1 The ship shall be suitably fitted and carry on board appropriate instruments for measuring the following without requiring entry into the cargo space: .1 concentration of methane in the atmosphere above the cargo; .2 concentration of oxygen in the atmosphere above the cargo; .3 concentration of carbon monoxide in the atmosphere above the cargo; .4 pH value of cargo hold bilge samples. These instruments shall be regularly serviced and calibrated. Ship personnel shall be trained in the use of such instruments. Details of gas measurement procedures are given at the end of this appendix. * Refer to Interpretation of stowage and segregation requirements for brown coal briquettes and coal related to "hot areas" in the IMSBC Code (MSC.l/Circ.1351). IMSBC CODE (Amendment 06-21) and supplement 2022 EDITION 121

122 IQUETTES (appendix, continued) ft is recommended that means be provided for monitoring the temperature of the cargo in the range of 0¬∞C to 100¬∞C to enable the measurement of temperature of the cargo during the voyage without requiring entry into the cargo space. Carriage 1 As far as practicable, any gases which may be emitted from the cargo shall not be allowed to accumulate in adjacent enclosed spaces, such as store-rooms, carpenter's shop, passageways, tunnels, etc. Such spaces shall be adequately ventilated and regularly monitored for methane, oxygen and carbon monoxide. 2 Under no 'circumstances, except in emergency, shall the hatches be opened or the cargo space be ventilated or entered during the voyage. 3 The atmosphere in the space above the cargo in each cargo space shall be regularly monitored for the concentrations of methane, oxygen and carbon monoxide. 4 The frequency of the monitoring shall be determined based upon the information provided by the shipper and the information obtained through the analysis of the atmosphere in the cargo space. The monitoring shall be conducted at least daily and as close as practical to the same time of day. The results of monitoring shall be recorded. The shipper may request more frequent monitoring, particularly if there is evidence of significant self-heating during the voyage. 5 The following issues shall be taken into account: 6 7 .1 The oxygen level in the sealed cargo space will fall from an initial 21% over a period of days to stabilize at levels of the order of 6 to 15%. If the oxygen level does not fall below 20%, or rapidly increases after an initial fall, it is possible that the cargo space is inadequately sealed and is at risk of spontaneous combustion . .2 Carbon monoxide levels will build up to concentrations which fluctuate in the 200 to 2,000 parts per million (ppm) range in a safe, well-sealed cargo space. A rapid increase of approximately 1,000 ppm in carbon monoxide levels in this cargo over a 24-hour period is a possible indicator of spontaneous combustion, particularly if accompanied by an increase in methane levels. .3 The methane composition in briquette cargo is normally low, less than 5 ppm, and does not constitute a hazard. However, a sudden and continuing rise in methane levels, to concentrations above 10 ppm, is an indicator of the occurrence of spontaneous combustion in the hold . .4 The temperature in this cargo in a well-sealed cargo space normally remains at 5 to 10¬∞C above seawater temperature, the increase being due to normal diurnal breathing of small quantities of air into the cargo space. Checking of the cargo space seals to minimize air leakage is essential. A rapid increase in temperature of approximately 20¬∞C over 24 hours is evidence of spontaneous combustion. Regular hold bilge testing shall be systematically carried out. If the pH monitoring indicates that a corrosion risk exists, the master shall ensure that all bilges are kept dry during the voyage in order to avoid possible accumulation of acids on tank tops and in the bilge system. When the behaviour of the cargo during the voyage differs from that specified in the cargo information, the master shall report such differences to the shipper. Such reports will enable the shipper to maintain records on the behaviour of this cargo, so that the information being provided to the master can be reviewed in the light of the transport experience.

Individual schedules of solid bulk cargoes BROWN COAL BRIQUETTES (appendix, continued) 8 When the master is concerned that the cargo is showing any signs of self-heating or spontaneous combustion, such as an increase in the concentration of methane or carbon monoxide or an increase in temperature, as described above, the following actions shall be taken: .1 Consult with the ship's agent at the loading port. The company's* designated person ashore shall be advised immediately . .2 Check the seal of the cargo space and re-seal the cargo space, as necessary . .3 Do not enter the cargo space and do not open the hatches, unless the master considers access is necessary for the safety of the ship or safety of life. When any ship's personnel have entered into a cargo space, re-seal the cargo space immediately after the personnel vacate the cargo space . .4 Increase the frequency of monitoring the gas composition, and temperature when practicable, of the cargo . .5 Send the following information, as soon as possible, to the ship's owner or agent at the loading port to obtain expert advice: Discharge .1 the number of cargo spaces involved; .2 monitoring results of the carbon monoxide, methane and oxygen concentrations; .3 if available, temperature of the cargo, location and method used to obtain results; .4 the time the gas analyses were taken (monitoring routine); .5 the quantity of the cargo in the cargo space(s) involved; .6 the description of the cargo as per the shipper's declaration, and any special precautions indicated on the declaration; .7 the date of loading, and estimated time of arrival (ETA) at the intended discharge port (which shall be specified); and .8 any other comments or observations the master may consider relevant. Prior to, and during, discharge: 1 The cargo space shall be kept closed until just before the commencement of discharge of that space. The cargo may be sprayed with a fine water spray to reduce dust. 2 Personnel shall not enter the cargo space without having tested the atmosphere above the cargo. The personnel entering into a cargo space in which the atmosphere contains oxygen levels below 21% shall wear self-contained breathing apparatus.t Carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide gas levels shall also be tested prior to entry into the cargo spaces. The recommended threshold limit value (TLV) for carbon monoxide is 50 ppm. 3 During discharge, attention shall be given to the cargo for signs of hot spots (i.e. steaming). If a hot spot is detected, the area shall be sprayed with fine water spray and the hot spot shall be removed immediately to prevent spreading. The hot spot cargo shall be spread out on the wharf away from the remainder of the cargo. 4 Prior to suspending the discharge of this cargo for more than 8 hours, the hatch covers and all other ventilation for the cargo space shall be closed. * Refer to SOLAS regulation IX/1.2. t Refer to Revised recommendations for entering enclosed spaces aboard ships (resolution A.1050(27)).

124 ;R.OWN COAL BRIQUETTES (appendix, continued) Procedures for gas monitoring of brown coal briquette cargoes 1 Observations 1.1 Carbon monoxide monitoring, when conducted in accordance with the following procedures, will provide a reliable early indication of self-heating within this cargo. This allows preventive action to be considered without delay. A sudden rapid rise in carbon monoxide detected within a cargo space, particularly if accompanied by an increase in methane levels, is a conclusive indication that self-heating is taking place. 1.2 All vessels engaged in the carriage of this cargo shall carry on board an instrument for measuring methane, oxygen and carbon monoxide gas concentrations, to enable the monitoring of the atmosphere within the cargo space. This instrument shall be regularly serviced and calibrated in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. Care shall be exercised in interpreting methane measurements carried out in the low oxygen concentrations often found in unventilated cargo holds. The catalytic sensors normally used for the detection of methane rely on the presence of sufficient oxygen for accurate measurement. This phenomenon does not affect the measurement of carbon monoxide, or measurement of methane by infrared sensor. Further guidance may be obtained from the instrument manufacturer. 2 Sampling and measurement procedure 2.1 Equipment 2.1.1 An instrument which is capable of measuring methane, oxygen and carbon monoxide concentrations shall be provided on board a ship carrying this cargo. The instrument shall be fitted with an aspirator, flexible connection and a length of spark-proof metal tubing to enable a representative sample to be obtained from within the square of the hatch. 2.1.2 When recommended by the manufacturer, a suitable filter shall be used to protect the instrument against the ingress of moisture. The presence of even a small amount of water will compromise the accuracy of the measurement. 2.2 Siting of sampling points 2.2.1 In order to obtain meaningful information about the behaviour of this cargo in a cargo space, gas measurements shall be made via one sample point per cargo space. To ensure flexibility of measurement in adverse weather, however, two sample points shall be provided per cargo space, one on the port side and one on the starboard side of the hatch cover or hatch coaming (refer to the diagram of gas sampling point). Measurement from either of these locations is satisfactory. 2.2.2 Each sample point shall comprise a hole of diameter approximately 12 mm positioned as near to the top of the hatch coaming as possible. It shall be sealed with a sealing cap to prevent ingress of water and air. It is essential this cap be securely replaced after each measurement to maintain a tight seal. 2.2.3 The provision of any sample point shall not compromise the seaworthiness of the vessel. 2.3 Measurement The explanation on procedures for measurement is as follows: .1 remove the sealing cap, insert the rigid tube into the sampling point and tighten the integral cap to ensure an adequate seal; .2 connect the instrument to the sampling tube; .3 draw a sample of the atmosphere through the tube, using the aspirator, until steady readings are obtained; IMSBC CODE (Amendment 06-21) and supplement 2022 EDITION

Appendix 1 COAL (appendix) Appendix COAL Properties and characteristics 1 Coals may ~mit methane, a flammable gas. A methane/air mixture containing between 5% and 16% methane constitutes an explosive atmosphere which can be ignited by sparks or naked flame, e.g. electrical or frictional sparks, a match or lighted cigarette. Methane is lighter than air and may, therefore, accumulate in the upper region of the cargo space or other enclosed spaces. If the cargo space boundaries are not tight, methane can seep through into spaces adjacent to the cargo space. 2 Coals may be subject to oxidation, leading to depletion of oxygen and an increase in carbon dioxide or carbon monoxide concentrations in the cargo space. Carbon monoxide is an odourless gas, slightly lighter than air and has flammable limits in air of 12% to 75% by volume. It is toxic by inhalation, with an affinity for blood haemoglobin over 200 times that of oxygen. 3 Some coals may heat spontaneously and the spontaneous heating may lead to spontaneous combustion in the cargo space. Flammable and toxic gases, including carbon monoxide, may be produced. 4 Some coals may be liable to react with water and produce acids which may cause corrosion. Flammable and toxic gases, including hydrogen, may be produced. Hydrogen is an odourless gas, much lighter than air, and has flammable limits in air of 4% to 75% by volume. Segregation and stowage requirements 1 Unless expressly provided otherwise, boundaries of cargo spaces where this cargo is carried shall be resistant to fire and liquids. 2 This cargo shall be "separated from" goods of classes 1 (division 1.4), 2, 3, 4 and 5 in packaged form (see IMDG Code) and "separated from" solid bulk materials of classes 4 and 5.1. 3 Stowage of goods of class 5.1 in packaged form or solid bulk materials of class 5.1 above or below this cargo shall be prohibited. 4 The master shall ensure that this cargo is not stowed adjacent to hot areas.* 5 This cargo shall be "separated longitudinally by an intervening complete compartment or hold from" goods of class 1 other than division 1 .4. Note: For interpretation of these terms, see section 9. General requirements for all types of these cargoes 1 Prior to loading, the shipper or his appointed agent shall provide in writing to the master the characteristics of the cargo and the recommended safe handling procedures for loading and transport of the cargo. As a minimum, the cargo's contract specifications for moisture content, sulphur content and size shall be stated, and especially whether the cargo may be liable to emit methane or self-heat. * Refer to Interpretation of stowage and segregation requirements for brown coal briquettes and coal related to "hot areas" in the IMSBC Code (MSC.1/Circ.1351). 154 IMSBC CODE (Amendment 06-21) and supplement 2022 EDITION

Individual schedules of solid bulk cargoes COAL (appendix, continued) 2 Before loading, the master shall ensure the following: .1 all cargo spaces and bilge wells are clean and dry. Any residue of waste material or previous cargo is removed, including removable cargo battens; and .2 all electrical cables and components situated in cargo spaces and adjacent enclosed spaces are free from defects. Such cables and electrical components are safe for use in an explosive atmosphere or positively isolated. The provisions of this clause need not apply to engine-rooms where the engine-room is separated from the cargo space by a gastig~t bulkhead with no direct access. 3 The ship shall be suitably fitted and carry on board appropriate instruments for measuring the following without requiring entry in the cargo space: .1 concentration of methane in the atmosphere; .2 concentration of oxygen in the atmosphere; .3 concentration of carbon monoxide in the atmosphere; and .4 pH value of cargo space bilge samples. 4 These instruments shall be regularly serviced and calibrated. Ship personnel shall be trained in the use of such instruments. Details of gas measurement procedures are given at the end of this appendix. 5 It is recommended that means be provided for measuring the temperature of the cargo in the range 0¬∞C to 100¬∞C to enable the measurement of temperature of the cargo while being loaded and during the voyage without requiring entry into the cargo space. 6 Smoking and the use of naked flames shall not be permitted in the cargo areas and adjacent spaces and appropriate warning notices shall be posted in conspicuous places. Burning, cutting, chipping, welding or other sources of ignition shall not be permitted in the vicinity of cargo spaces or in other adjacent spaces, unless the space has been properly ventilated and the methane gas measurements indicate it is safe to do so. 7 Prior to departure, the master shall be satisfied that the surface of the material has been trimmed reasonably level to the boundaries of the cargo space to avoid the formation of gas pockets and to prevent air from permeating the body of the briquettes. Casings leading into the cargo space shall be adequately sealed. The shipper shall ensure that the master receives the necessary cooperation from the loading terminal. 8 The atmosphere in the space above the cargo in each space shall be regularly monitored for the concentration of methane, oxygen and carbon monoxide. Details of gas monitoring procedures are given at the end of this appendix. The results of monitoring shall be recorded. The frequency of the monitoring shall be determined based upon the information provided by the shipper and the information obtained through the analysis of the atmosphere in the cargo space. 9 Unless expressly provided otherwise, surface ventilation shall be conducted in all cargo spaces carrying this cargo for the first 24 hours after departure from the loading port. During this period, the atmosphere in the cargo spaces shall be monitored once from one sample point per cargo space and, for the purpose of the gas monitoring, the ventilation shall be stopped for an appropriate period prior to the gas monitoring. 10 When the methane concentrations monitored within 24 hours after departure are at an acceptably low level, the ventilation openings shall be closed and the atmosphere in the cargo spaces shall be monitored. When the methane concentrations monitored within 24 hours after departure are not at an acceptably low level, surface ventilation shall be maintained, except for an appropriate period for gas monitoring, and the atmosphere in the cargo spaces shall be monitored. This procedure shall be followed until the methane concentrations become acceptably low level. In any event, the atmosphere in the cargo spaces shall be monitored on a daily basis. IMSBC CODE (Amendment 06-21) and supplement 2022 EDITION 155

156 COAL (appendix, continued) 11 When significant concentrations of methane are subsequently observed in unventilated cargo spaces, the appropriate special precautions for coals emitting methane shall apply. 12 The master shall ensure, as far as practicable, that any gases which may be emitted from this cargo do not accumulate in adjacent enclosed spaces. 13 The master shall ensure that enclosed working spaces such as storerooms, carpenter's shop, passageways, tunnels, etc., are regularly monitored for the presence of methane, oxygen and carbon monoxide. Such spaces shall be adequately ventilated. 14 Regular hold bilge testing shall be systematically carried out during the voyage carrying this cargo. If the pH monitoring indicates that a corrosion risk exists, bilges shall be frequently pumped out during the voyage in order to avoid possible accumulation of acids on tank tops and in the bilge system. 15 If the behaviour of the cargo during the voyage differs from that specified in the cargo declaration, the master shall report such differences to the shipper. Such reports will enable the shipper to maintain records on the behaviour of the coal cargoes, so that the information provided to the master can be reviewed in the light of transport experience. Special precautions 1 Coals emitting methane When the shipper has informed that the cargo is liable to emit methane or analysis of the atmosphere in the cargo space indicates the presence of methane in excess of 20% of the Lower Explosion Limit (LEL), the following additional precautions shall be taken: .1 Adequate surface ventilation shall be maintained, except for an appropriate period for the purpose of gas monitoring . .2 Care shall be taken to remove any accumulated gases prior to operation of the hatch covers or other openings for any reason, including discharging. Care shall be taken to operate hatch covers of the cargo spaces and other openings to avoid creating sparks. Smoking and the use of naked flame shall be prohibited . .3 Personnel shall not be permitted to enter the cargo space or enclosed adjacent spaces unless the space has been ventilated and the atmosphere tested and found to be gas-free and to have sufficient oxygen to support life. Notwithstanding these provisions, emergency entry into the cargo space may be permitted without ventilation, testing the atmosphere or both, provided that the entry into the cargo space is undertaken only by trained personnel wearing self-contained breathing apparatus under the supervision of a responsible officer and special precautions are observed to ensure that no source of ignition is carried into the space . .4 The master shall ensure that enclosed working spaces such as storerooms, carpenter's shops, passageways, tunnels, etc., are regularly monitored for the presence of methane. Such spaces shall be adequately ventilated and, in the case of mechanical ventilation, only equipment safe for use in an explosive atmosphere shall be used. 2 Self-heating coals When the shipper informed that the cargo is likely to self-heat or analysis of the atmosphere in the cargo space indicates an increasing concentration of carbon monoxide, then the following additional precautions shall be taken: .1 The cargo spaces shall be closed immediately after completion of loading in each cargo space. The hatch covers may also be additionally sealed with a suitable sealing tape. Only natural surface ventilation shall be permitted and ventilation shall be limited to the absolute minimum time necessary to remove methane which may have accumulated. IMSBC CODE (Amendment 06-21) and supplement 2022 EDITION

Individual schedules of solid bulk cargoes COAL (appendix, continued) .2 Personnel shall not enter the cargo space during the voyage, unless they are wearing self-contained breathing apparatus and access is critical to safety of life and the safety of the ship. .3 Prior to loading, temperature of this cargo shall be monitored. This cargo shall only be accepted for loading when the temperature of the cargo is not higher than 55¬∞C. .4 When the carbon monoxide level is increasing steadily, a potential self-heating may be developing. In such a case, the cargo space shall be completely closed and all ventilation ceased, antj the master shall seek expert advice immediately. Water shall not be used for cooling material or fighting coal cargo fires at sea, but may be used for cooling the boundaries of the cargo space. .5 When the carbon monoxide level in any cargo space reaches 50 ppm or exhibits a steady rise over three consecutive days, a self-heating condition may be developing and the master shall inform the shipper and the company* of, at least, the following information if an accurate assessment of the situation is to be achieved: .1 identity of the cargo spaces involved; monitoring results covering carbon monoxide, methane and oxygen concentrations; .2 if available, temperature of the cargo, location and method used to obtain results; .3 time gas sample taken (monitoring routine); .4 time ventilators opened/dosed; .5 quantity of coal in hold(s) involved; .6 type of coal as per cargo information, and any special precautions indicated on information; .7 date loaded, and ETA at intended discharge port (which shall be specified); and .8 comments or observations from the ship's master. 3 Gravity-fed self-unloading bulk carrier 3.1 A gravity-fed self-unloading bulk carrier means a vessel that has gravity-fed systems from the bottom of cargo holds, using gates that may be opened or closed to feed the cargo onto conveyor belts. Such belts run in a fore and aft direction underneath the holds; from there the cargo is carried by means of conveyor systems to the deck and discharged onto shore with a self-unloading boom that can extend over the shore and has a conveyor belt. This is not applicable for the vessels with unloading systems such as cranes and grabs. 3.2 When this cargo is carried on a gravity-fed self-unloading bulk carrier, the following requirements of this appendix need not apply: paragraph 1 of "Segregation and stowage requirements"; and paragraph 9 of "General requirements for all types of these cargoes". 3.3 Loaded voyage procedures for atmospheric monitoring of cargoes 3.3.1 Bulk coal cargo safety procedures 3.3.1.1 These requirements apply when these cargoes are to be carried on a gravity-fed self-unloading bulk carrier. It is recommended that a document, such as a flow chart, describing cargo operations and carriage procedures for these cargoes be provided to the ship by the vessel's operator. 3.4 Ventilation 3.4.1 When ventilating, it shall be ensured that excess air does not ingress excessively into the body of the cargo of coal as this may eventually promote self-heating. * Refer to SOLAS regulation IX/1.2. IMSBC CODE (Amendment 06-21) and supplement 2022 EDITION 157

Appendix 1 COAL (appendix, continued) 3.4.2 Due to the presence of non-airtight unloading gates at the bottom of the cargo hoppers just above the tunnels, the following methods of ventilation shall be used: if methane is detected in the tunnel, it shall be "positive-pressure" ventilated (more supply than exhaust in the tunnels, to remove methane gas); and if carbon monoxide is detected in the tunnel, it shall be "negative-pressure" ventilated (more exhaust than supply in the tunnels, to remove carbon monoxide). The release of carbon monoxide may be an indication of self-heating. Procedures for gas monitoring of coal cargoes 1 Observations 1.1 Carbon monoxide monitoring, when conducted in accordance with the following procedures, will provide a reliable early indication of self-heating within this cargo. This allows preventive action to be considered without delay. A steady rise in the level of carbon monoxide detected within a cargo space is a conclusive indication that self-heating is taking place. 1.2 All vessels engaged in the carriage of this cargo shall carry on board an instrument for measuring methane, oxygen and carbon monoxide gas concentrations, to enable the monitoring of the atmosphere within the cargo space. This instrument shall be regularly serviced and calibrated in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. Care shall be exercised in interpreting methane measurements carried out in the low oxygen concentrations often found in unventilated cargo holds. The catalytic sensors normally used for the detection of methane rely on the presence of sufficient oxygen for accurate measurement. This phenomenon does not affect the measurement of carbon monoxide, or measurement of methane by infrared sensor. Further guidance may be obtained from the instrument manufacturer. 2 Sampling and measurement procedure 2.1 Equipment 2.1.1 An instrument which is capable of measuring methane, oxygen and carbon monoxide concentrations shall be provided on board a ship carrying this cargo. The instrument shall be fitted with an aspirator, flexible connection and a length of spark-proof metal tubing to enable a representative sample to be obtained from within the square of the hatch. 2.1.2 When recommended by the manufacturer, a suitable filter shall be used to protect the instrument against the ingress of moisture. The presence of even a small amount of moisture will compromise the accuracy of the measurement. 2.2 Siting of sampling points 2.2.1 In order to obtain meaningful information about the behaviour of this cargo in a cargo space, gas measurements shall be made via one sample point per cargo space. To ensure flexibility of measurement in adverse weather, two sample points shall be provided per cargo space, one on the port side and one on the starboard side of the hatch cover or hatch coaming. (Refer to the diagram of gas sampling point.) Measurement from either of these locations is satisfactory. 2.2.2 Each sample point shall comprise a hole of diameter approximately 12 mm positioned as near to the top of the hatch coaming as possible. It shall be sealed with a sealing cap to prevent ingress of water and air. It is essential that this cap is securely replaced after each measurement to maintain a tight seal. 2.2.3 The provisions of any sample point shall not compromise the seaworthiness of the vessel. 158 IMSBC CODE (Amendment 06-21) and supplement 2022 EDITION

IMSBC CODE (Amendment 06-21) and supplement 2022 EDITION 159

COAL (appendix, continued) 2.4 Measurement strategy The identification of incipient self-heating from measurement of gas concentrations is more readily achieved under unventilated conditions. This is not always desirable because of the possibility of the accumulation of methane to dangerous concentrations. This is primarily, but not exclusively, a problem in the early stages of a voyage. Therefore it is recommended that cargo spaces are initially ventilated until measured methane concentrations are at an acceptably low level. 2.5 Measurement in unventilated holds Under normal conditions, one measurement per day is sufficient as a precautionary measure. However, if carbon monoxide levels are higher than 30 ppm then the frequency shall be increased to at least twice a day at suitably spaced intervals. Any additional results shall be logged. 2.6 Measurement in ventilated holds 2.6.1 If the presence of methane is such that the ventilators are required to remain open, then a different procedure shall be applied to enable the onset of any incipient self-heating to be detected. 2.6.2 To obtain meaningful data the ventilators shall be closed for a period before the measurements are taken. This period may be chosen to suit the operational requirements of the vessel, but it is recommended that it is not less than 4 hours. It is vital in the interests of data interpretation that the shutdown time is constant whichever time period is selected. These measurements shall be taken on a daily basis. 2.7 Measurement in cargo and self-unloading spaces of gravity-fed self-unloading bulk carrier 2.7.1 Measurement in unventilated cargo and self-unloading spaces 2.7.1.1 When the shipper has declared that the coal cargo has or may have self-heating characteristics, the holds shall not be ventilated unless otherwise specified in this section. 2. 7.1.2 Under normal conditions, one measurement per day is sufficient as a precautionary measure. If carbon monoxide levels are higher than 30 ppm then the frequency of measurements shall be increased to at least twice daily, at suitable intervals. Any additional results shall be logged. 2.7.1.3 If the carbon monoxide level in any hold indicates a steady rise or reaches 50 ppm, a self-heating condition may be developing and the owners of the vessel shall be notified as outlined in the procedures. Above this level, the vessel shall operate on "negative-pressure" ventilation, in order to reduce the amount of carbon monoxide. Regular monitoring of carbon monoxide levels shall continue. 2.7.1.4 Persons entering cargo or unloading spaces with carbon monoxide levels higher than 30 ppm shall not do so without self-contained breathing apparatus.* 2.7.2 Measurement in ventilated cargo and self-unloading spaces 2.7.2.1 If the presence of methane is indicated by monitor, and such that ventilation is required, then a different procedure shall be applied to enable the onset of any possible self-heating to be detected. "Positive-pressure" or "through ventilation" shall be operated to remove the methane. ‚Ä¢ Refer to Revised recommendations for entering enclosed spaces aboard ships (resolution A.1050(27)) (see the supplement of this publication). 160 IMSBC CODE (Amendment 06-21) and supplement 2022 EDITION

Individual schedules of solid bulk cargoes COAL (appendix, concluded) 2.7.2.2 To obtain meaningful data, the ventilators and/or ventilation shall be closed for a period before measurements are taken. This period may be chosen to suit the operational requirements of the vessel, but it is recommended that it is not less than 4 hours. It is vital, in the interests of data interpretation, that the shutdown time is constant whichever time period is selected. These measurements shall be taken on a daily basis. If the carbon monoxide results exhibit a steady rise, or exceed 50 ppm on any day, the owner shall be notified. 2.7.2.3 In addition, the following points shall be considered: - at no t1me shall ventilation be shut down when crew members are in the self-unloading spaces; - special fire-fighting equipment and/or procedures may be necessary for the vessel; and - establish specific crew training for gravity-fed self-unloading bulk carriers.

Individual schedules of solid bulk cargoes DIRECT REDUCED IRON (C) (By-product fines) Description Direct reduced iron (ORI) (C) is a porous, black/grey metallic material generated as a by-product of the manufacturing and handling processes of DRI (A) and/or DRI (B). The density of DRI (C) is less than 5,000 kg/m 3 . Characteristics - Physical properties Size Angle of repose Bulk density Stowage factor (kg/m 3) (m 3 /t) Fines and small particles with an average size less than Not applicable 1,850 to 3,300 0.30 to 0.54 6.35 mm, no particles to exceed 12 mm Hazard classification Class Subsidiary MHB Group hazard(s) Not applicable Not applicable SH and/or WF B Hazard Temporary increase in temperature of about 30¬∞C due to self-heating may be expected after material hand\ing in bulk. There is a risk of overheating, fire and explosion during transport. This cargo reacts with air and with fresh water or seawater, to produce hydrogen and heat. Hydrogen is a flammable gas that can form an explosive mixture when mixed with air in concentrations above 4% by volume. Cargo heating may generate very high temperatures that are sufficient to lead to self-heating, auto-ignition and explosion. Oxygen in cargo spaces and in enclosed adjacent spaces may be depleted. Flammable gas may also build up in these spaces. All precautions shall be taken when entering cargo and enclosed adjacent spaces. The reactivity of this cargo is extremely difficult to assess due to the nature of the material that can be included in the category. A worst case scenario should therefore be assumed at all times. Stowage and segregation "Separated from" goods of classes 1 (division 1 .4S), 2, 3, 4 and 5, and class 8 acids in packaged form (see IMDG Code). "Separated from" solid bulk materials of classes 4 and 5. Goods of class 1, other than division 1.4S, shall not be carried in the same ship. Boundaries of compartments where this cargo is carried shall be resistant to fire and passage of liquid. Hold cleanliness Cargo spaces shall be clean, dry and free of salt and residues of previous cargoes. Prior to loading, wooden fixtures such as battens, loose dunnage, debris and combustible materials shall be removed. IMSBC CODE (Amendment06-21) and supplement 2022 EDITION 193

This cargo shall not be loaded onto ships, or transferred between ships or barges, during ANY precipitation. During loading of this cargo, all non-working hatches of cargo spaces into which this cargo is loaded, or is to be loaded, shall be kept closed. Loading Prior to loading, the terminal shall ensure that the conveyor belts and all other equipment used for loading this cargo contain no accumulation of water or other substances. Each time cargo operations are commenced or restarted, particularly after rain or washing down, any loading belt shall be operated empty and not over a ship's cargo space. Prior to loading, an ultrasonic test or another equivalent method with a suitable instrument shall be conducted to ensure weathertightness of the hatch covers and closing arrangements and all readings shall confirm weathertightness. Prior to loading this cargo, the shipper shall provide the master with a certificate issued by a competent person recognized by the competent authority of the port of loading stating that the cargo, at the time of loading, is suitable for shipment; that it conforms with the requirements of this Code; that the moisture content is less than 0.3%; and the temperature does not exceed 65¬∞C. This certificate shall state that the cargo meets the loading criteria with regard to ageing and material temperature. As the density of the cargo is extremely high, the tank top may be overstressed unless the cargo is evenly spread across the tank top to equalize the weight distribution. Due consideration shall be given to ensure that the tank top is not overstressed during the voyage and during loading by a pile of the cargo. The cargo shall not be accepted for loading when its temperature is in excess of 65¬∞C or if its moisture content is in excess of 0.3%. Any cargo that has been wetted, or is known to have been wetted, shall not be loaded into any cargo space. Trim in accordance with the relevant provisions required under sections 4 and 5 of this Code. The cargo temperature shall be monitored during loading and recorded in a log detailing the temperature for each lot of cargo loaded, a copy of which shall be provided to the master. After loading, a certificate shall be issued by a competent person recognized by the competent authority of the port of loading confirming that throughout the whole consignment of fines and small particles the moisture content has not exceeded 0.3% and the temperature does not exceed 65¬∞C. On completion of loading of a cargo space it shall be immediately closed and sealed. Sufficient inert gas shall then be introduced to achieve an oxygen concentration less than 5% throughout the cargo space. Precautions Due consideration shall be given to the possibility of moisture inside the cargo pile in order to avoid loading of wet cargo or a wet part of the cargo, recognizing that the bottom of the pile can be wet even though the surface of cargo pile looks dry. The carrier's nominated technical persons or other representatives shall have reasonable access to stockpiles and loading installations for inspection. Prior to shipment, the cargo shall be aged for at least 30 days and a certificate confirming this shall be issued by a competent person recognized by the competent authority of the port of loading. Shippers shall provide to the master, prior to loading, comprehensive information on the cargo and safety procedures to be followed in the event of emergency. This advice may be an amplification of this Code, but shall not be contrary thereto in respect of safety. IMSBC CODE (Amendment 06-21) and supplement 2022 EDITION

Appendix 2 Laboratory test procedures, associated apparatus and standards 1 Test procedures for materials which may liquefy or undergo dynamic separation and associated apparatus Six methods of testing for the transportable moisture limit are currently in general use: .1 flow table test; .2 penetration test; and .3 Proctor/Fagerberg test. As each method has its advantages, the selection of the test method should be determined by local practices or by the appropriate authorities . .4 Modified Proctor/Fagerberg test procedure for iron ore fines; .5 Modified Proctor/Fagerberg test procedure for coal; and .6 Modified Proctor/Fagerberg test procedure for bauxite. 1.1 Flow table test procedure 1.1.1 Scope The flow table is generally suitable for mineral concentrates or other fine material with a maximum grain size of 1 mm. It may also be applicable to materials with a maximum grain size up to 7 mm. It will not be suitable for materials coarser than this and may also not give satisfactory results for some materials with high clay content. If the flow table test is not suitable for the material in question, the procedures to be adopted should be those approved by the authority of the port State. The test described below provides for determination of: .1 the moisture content of a sample of cargo, hereinafter referred to as the test material; .2 the flow moisture point (FMP) of the test material under impact or cyclic forces of the flow table apparatus; and .3 the transportable moisture limit of the test material. 1.1.2 Apparatus (see figure 1.1.2) .1 Standard flow table and frame (ASTM Designation (C230-68) - see 3) . .2 Flow table mounting (ASTM Designation (C230-68) - see 3) . . 3 Mould (ASTM Designation (C230-68) - see 3) . .4 Tamper (see figure 1.1.2.4): the required tamping pressure may be achieved by using calibrated, spring-loaded tampers (examples are included in figure 1.1.2.4) or some other suitable design of tamper that allows a controlled pressure to be applied via a 30 mm diameter tamper head . . 5 Scales and weights (ASTM Designation (C109-73) - see 3) and suitable sample containers . .6 Glass graduated measuring cylinder and burette having capacities of 100-200 ml and 10 ml, respectively.

Laboratory test procedures, associated apparatus and standards .7 A hemispherical mixing bowl approximately 30 cm diameter, rubber gloves and drying dishes or pans. Alternatively, an automatic mixer of similar capacity can be used for the mixing operations. In this case, care should be exercised to ensure that the use of such a mechanical mixer does not reduce the particle size or consistency of the test material. .8 A drying oven with controlled temperature up to approximately 110¬∞C. This oven should be without air circulation. 1.1.3 Temperature and humidity It is preferable to work in a room where the samples will be protected from excessive temperatures, air currents and humidity variations. All phases of the material preparation and testing procedure should be accomplished in a reasonable space of time to minimize moisture losses and, in any event, within the day of commencement. Where possible, sample containers should be covered with plastic film or other suitable cover. 1.1.4 Procedure The quantity of material required for a flow moisture test will vary according to the specific gravity of the material to be tested. It will range from approximately 2 kg for coal to 3 kg for mineral concentrates. It should be collected as a representative sample of the cargo being shipped. Experience has shown that more accurate test results will be obtained by ensuring that the moisture content of the test sample is increased rather than decreased towards the FMP. Consequently, it is recommended that a preliminary flow moisture test should be conducted, generally in accordance with the following, to indicate the condition of the test sample, i.e. the quantity of water and the rate at which it is to be added or whether the sample should be air-dried to reduce its moisture content before commencing the main flow moisture test. 1.1.4.1 Preparation of the test sample The representative sample of test material is placed in the mixing bowl and thoroughly mixed. Three subsamples (A), (B) and (C) are removed from the mixing bowl as follows: about one fifth of the sample (A) should be immediately weighed and placed in the drying oven to determine the moisture content of the sample "as-received". Two further subsamples, each of about two fifths of the gross weight, should then be taken, one (B) for the preliminary FMP test and the other (C) for the main FMP determination: .1 Filling the mould. The mould is placed on the centre of the flow table and filled in three stages with the material from the mixing bowl. The first charge, after tamping, should aim to fill the mould to approximately one third of its depth. The quantity of sample required to achieve this will vary from one material to another, but can readily be established after some experience has been gained of the packing characteristics of the material being tested. The second charge, after tamping, should fill the mould to about two thirds of its depth and the third and final charge, after tamping, should reach to just below the top of the mould (see figure 1.1.4-2) . .2 Tamping procedure. The aim of tamping is to attain a degree of compaction similar to that prevailing at the bottom of a shipboard cargo of the material being tested. The correct pressure to be applied is calculated from: Tamping pressure (Pa) = Bulk density of cargo (kg/m 3) x Maximum depth of cargo (m) x Gravity acceleration (m/s 2) Bulk density can be measured by a single test, using the Proctor C apparatus described in ASTM Standard D-698 or JIS-A-1210, on a sample of the cargo at the proposed moisture content of loading. When calculating the tamping pressure, if no information concerning cargo depth is available the maximum likely depth should be used. IMSBC CODE (Amendment 06-21) and supplement 2022 EDITION 455

Appendix 2 .3 Alternatively, the pressure may be estimated from table 1.1.4.1. The number of tamping actions (applying the correct, steady pressure each time) should be about 35 for the bottom layer, 25 for the middle and 20 for the top layer, tamping successively over the area completely to the edges of the sample to achieve a uniformly flat surface for each layer. Removal of the mould. The mould is tapped on its side until it becomes loose, leaving the sample in the shape of a truncated cone on the table. Typical cargo Bulk density ' (kg/m 3) Table 1.1.4.1 Maximum cargo depth 2m 5 m 10m ----Tamper pressure (kPa) ----- 100{7.J) 200 (14.1) 300 (21;2)' ¬∑ . 20m .2.00 (14.1) 400 (28.3) 600 (42.4) 800 (56.5) 1,000 (70.7) (values in parenthesis are equivalent kgf when applied via a 30 mm diameter tamper head) 1.1.4.2 The preliminary flow moisture test .1 Immediately after removing the mould, the flow table is raised and dropped up to 50 times through a height of 12.5 mm at a rate of 25 times per minute. If the material is below the FMP, it usually crumbles and bumps off in fragments with successive drops of the table (see figure 1.1.4-3) . . 2 At this stage, the flow table is stopped and the material returned to the mixing bowl, where 5-10 ml of water, or possibly more, is sprinkled over the surface and thoroughly mixed into the material, either with rubber-gloved fingers or an automatic mixer. The mould is again filled and the flow table is operated as described in 1.1.4.2.1 for up to 50 drops. If a flow state is not developed, the process is repeated with further additions of water until a flow state has been reached . .3 Identification of a flow state. The impacting action of the flow table causes the grains to rearrange themselves to produce compaction of the mass. As a result, the fixed volume of moisture contained in the material at any given level increases as a percentage of the total volume. A flow state is considered to have been reached when the moisture content and compaction of the sample produce a level of saturation such that plastic deformation occurs.* At this stage, the moulded sides of the sample may deform, giving a convex or concave profile (see figure 1.1.4-4). With repeated action of the flow table, the sample continues to slump and to flow outwards. In certain materials, cracks may also develop on the top surface. Cracking, with the appearance of free moisture, is not, however, an indication of development of a flow state. In most cases, measurement of the deformation is helpful in deciding whether or not plastic flow has occurred. A template which, for example, will indicate an increase in diameter of up to 3 mm in any part of the cone is a useful guide for this purpose. Some additional observations may be useful. For example: when the (increasing) moisture content is approaching the FMP, the sample cone begins to show a tendency to stick to the mould. Further, when the sample is pushed off the table, the sample may leave tracks (stripes) of moisture on the table. If such stripes are seen, the moisture content may be above the FMP: the absence of tracks (stripes) is not necessarily an indication of being below the FMP. ‚Ä¢ In certain conditions, the diameter of the cone may increase before the flow moisture point is reached, due to low friction between the grains rather than to plastic flow. This must not be mistaken for a flow state. 456 IMSBC CODE (Amendment 06-21) and supplement 2022 EDITION

Laboratory test procedures, associated apparatus and standards Measuring the diameter of the cone, at the base or at half height, will always be useful. By addition of water in increments of 0.4% to 0.5% and applying 25 drops of the flow table, the first diameter increase will generally be between 1 and 5 mm and after a further increment of water the base diameter will have expanded by between 5 and 10 mm . .4 As an alternative to the procedure described above, for many concentrates a fast way of finding the approximate FMP is as follows: When the moisture content is definitely beyond the FMP, measure the diameter after 25 drops, repeat the test after adding a further increment of water, measure the diameter and draw a diagram as illustrated in figure 1.1.4-1, showing increase in diameter plotted against moisture content. A straight line drawn through the two points will cross the moisture content axis close to the FMP. Having completed the preliminary FMP test, the sample for the main test is adjusted to the required level of moisture content (about 1% to 2%) below the flow point.

Appendix 2 Figure 1.1.4-3 Figure 1.1.4-4 1.1.4.3 Main flow moisture test 458 When a flow state has been reached in the preliminary test, the moisture content of subsample (C) is adjusted to about 1% to 2% less than the last value which did not cause flow in the preliminary test (this is suggested simply to avoid starting the main test too close to the FMP and then having to waste time air-drying it and starting again). The final test is then carried out on this adjusted sample in the same manner as for the preliminary test, but in this case with the addition of water in increments of no more than 0.5% of the mass of the test material (the lower the "preliminary" FMP, the smaller the increments should be). After each stage, the whole moulded sample should be placed in a container, weighed immediately and retained for moisture determination if required. This will be necessary if the sample flowed or if the next, slightly wetter, sample flows. If not required, it may be returned to the mixing bowl. When a flow state has been reached, the moisture content should be determined on two samples, one with moisture content just above the FMP and the other with moisture content just below the FMP. The difference between the two values should then be 0.5% or less, and the FMP is taken as the mean of these two values. IMSBC CODE (Amendment 06-21) and supplement 2022 EDITION

Laboratory test procedures, associated apparatus and standards 1.1.4.4 Determination of moisture content Introduction It should be noted that, for many materials, there are recognized international and national methods for determining moisture content. These methods, or ones that have been established to give equivalent results, should be followed. Concentrates and similar materials It is clearly important that the samples should be dried to a constant mass. In practice, this is ascertained after q suitable drying period at 105¬∞C by weighing the sample successively with an interval of several hours elapsing. If the mass remains constant, drying has been completed, whereas if the mass is still decreasing, drying should be continued. The length of the drying period depends upon many variables, such as the disposition of the material in the oven, the type of container used, the particle size, the rate of heat transfer, etc. It may be that a period of 5 hours is ample for one concentrate sample, whereas it is not sufficient for another. Sulphide concentrates tend to oxidize, and therefore the use of drying ovens with air circulation systems is not recommended for these materials, nor should the test sample be left in the drying oven for more than 4 hours. Coal The recommended methods for determination of the moisture content are those described in ISO 589-1974, "Hard Coal - Determination of Total Moisture". This method, or ones that have been established to give equivalent results, should be followed. Calculation of moisture content, FMP and transportable moisture limit: Taking m 1 as the exact mass of the subsample "as-received" (see 1.1.4.1), Taking m 2 as the exact mass of the "as-received" subsample, after drying, Taking m 3 as the exact mass of the sample just above the flow state (see 1.1.4.3), Taking m 4 as the exact mass of the sample just above the flow state, after drying, Taking m 5 as the exact mass of the sample just below the flow state (see 1.1.4.3), Taking m 6 as the exact mass of the sample just below the flow state, after drying, Then: .1 The moisture content of the concentrate "as-received" is (m m) . 1 m 2 x 100, m percent (1.1.4.4.1) 1 .2 The FMP of the material is (m3 m4) (ms m6) m + m 3 2 5 x 100, in per cent (1.1.4.4.2) .3 The transportable moisture limit of the material is 90% of the FMP. Peat moss For all peat moss, determine the bulk density, using either the ASTM or CEN (20 L) method. Peat should be above or below 90 kg/m 3 on a dry weight basis in order to obtain the correct TML. As indicated in 1.1.1, the following should be determined: .1 the moisture content of a sample of cargo (MC); .2 the flow moisture point (FMP); IMSBC CODE (Amendment 06-21) and supplement 2022 EDITION 459

Appendix 2 .3 the transportable moisture limit (TML). The TML will be determined as follows: .3.1 for peat with a bulk density of greater than 90 kg/m 3 on a dry weight, the TML is 85% of the FMP; and .3.2 for peat with a bulk density of 90 kg/m 3 or less on a dry weight, the TML is 90% of the FMP. 1.2 Penetration test procedure The penetration test constitutes a procedure whereby a material in a cylindrical vessel is vibrated. The flow moisture point is determined on the basis of the penetration depth of an indicator. 1.2.1 Scope .1 The penetration test is generally suitable for mineral concentrates, similar materials, and coals up to a top size of 25 mm . .2 In this procedure, the sample, in a cylindrical vessel, is subjected to vertical vibration of 2 g rms ¬± 10% (g = gravity acceleration) for 6 minutes. When the penetration depth of a bit put on the surface exceeds 50 mm, it is judged that the sample contains a moisture content greater than the flow moisture point. .3 This procedure consists of a preliminary test to get an approximate value of the flow moisture point and a main test to determine the accurate flow moisture point. When the approximate value of the flow moisture point is known, the preliminary test can be omitted . .4 The room where the samples are tested should be prepared as mentioned in 1.1.3. 1.2.2 Apparatus (see figure 1.2.2) .1 The test apparatus consists of: .1 a vibrating table; .2 cylindrical vessels; .3 indicators (penetration bits and a holder); .4 a tamper (see 1.1.2.4); and .5 ancillary equipment (see 1.1.2.5 to .8) . . 2 The vibrator (see figure 1.2.2.2), with a table on which a cylindrical vessel can be clamped, should be capable of exciting a mass of 30 kg at a frequency of either 50 Hz or 60 Hz with an acceleration of 3 g rms or more, and it can be controlled to adjust the acceleration level. .3 Dimensions of cylindrical vessels (see figures 1.2.2.3-1 and 1.2.2.3-2) are as follows: Cylinder size Inner diameter Depth Wall thickness small 146mm 202 mm 9.6 mm or more large 194 mm 252 mm 10.3 mm or more The vessels should be made of reasonably rigid, non-magnetic, impermeable and lightweight material such as acrylics or vinyl chloride. The small cylindrical vessel is selected for the materials having a maximum particle size of 10 mm or less. The large cylindrical vessel is for those having a maximum particle size of 25 mm or less . .4 Penetration bits (see figure 1.2.2.4) are made of brass. The mass of the bit for coal should be adjusted to 88 g (5 kPa), and that for concentrates to 177 g (10 kPa). When the sample contains coarse particles, it is recommended that two bits of the same pressure are put on the surface to avoid misjudgement. 460 IMSBC CODE (Amendment 06-21) and supplement 2022 EDITION

The amount of representative test sample with which each container is filled should be as follows: approximately 1,700 cm 3 for the small container, and 4,700 cm 3 for the large container . . 2 Mix the sample well and divide into three approximately equal subsamples, namely (A), (B) and (C). The subsample (A) should be immediately weighed and placed in the drying oven to determine the moisture content of the sample "as-received". The subsamples (B) and (C) are used for the preliminary test and the main test, respectively. IMSBC CODE (Amendment 06-21) and supplement 2022 EDITION

Laboratory test procedures, associated apparatus and standards .3 The vibration level of the vibrating table should be calibrated, using an acceleration meter, prior to carrying out testing. The acceleration of the table should be adjusted to 2 g rms ¬± 10% with a container filled with a sample mounted on the table. 1.2.3.2 Preliminary flow moisture test This test is intended to measure quickly the approximate flow moisture point, using subsample (B). Water is added in increments after every penetration test. When a flow state has been reached, the moisture content of the sample just above the flow state is measured. The moisture content of the sample just below the flow state can be calculated by deducting the increment of water last added from the gross mass of the sample. .1 Fill the appropriate cylindrical vessel with subsample (B) in four distinct stages and tamp after the addition of each layer, using a specified tamper. Tamp to a pressure denoted in 1.1.4.1 for mineral concentrates or to 40 kPa for coals, and apply the pressure evenly over the whole surface area of the material until a uniformly flat surface is obtained . . 2 Place the penetration bit on the surface of the material through the holder . . 3 Operate the vibrator at a frequency of 50 Hz or 60 Hz with an acceleration of 2 g rms ¬± 10% for 6 minutes. If necessary, the acceleration level should be checked by referring to the output of the acceleration meter attached to the vibrating table . .4 After 6 minutes of vibration, read the depth of penetration . . 5 When the depth of penetration is less than 50 mm, it is judged that liquefaction did not take place. Then: .1 Remove the material from the cylindrical vessel and replace in the mixing bowl with the remainder of the sample. . 2 Mix well and weigh the contents of the mixing bowl. .3 Sprinkle an increment of water of not more than 1% of the mass of the material in the bowl and mix well. .4 Repeat the procedure described in 1.2.3.2.1 to 1.2.3.2.5. .6 When the depth of penetration is greater than 50 mm, it is judged that liquefaction took place. Then: .1 Remove the material from the cylindrical vessel and replace in the mixing bowl. .2 Measure the moisture content in accordance with the procedure described in 1.1 .4.4. . 3 Calculate the moisture content of the sample just below the flow moisture point on the basis of the amount of water added . .7 If the penetration depth in the first attempt exceeds 50 mm, i.e. the sample as-received liquefied, mix subsamples (B) and (C) and dry at room temperature to reduce the moisture. Then, divide the material into two subsamples (B) and (C), and repeat the preliminary test. 1.2.3.3 The main flow moisture test .1 On the basis of the preliminary test, the main test should be carried out to determine the flow moisture point more accurately. . 2 Adjust the moisture content of the subsample (C) to the last value which did not cause flow in the preliminary flow moisture test. .3 The first test of the main flow moisture test is carried out on this adjusted sample in the same manner as described in 1.2.3.2. In this case, however, the addition of water in increments should not be more than 0.5% of the mass of the test material. .4 When the approximate value of the flow moisture point is known in advance, the moisture content of the subsample (C) is adjusted to approximately 90% of this value . . 5 When a flow state has been reached, the flow moisture point is determined as described in 1.1.4.3.

This method should not be used for coal or other porous materials. . 2 Before the Proctor/Fagerberg test is applied to coarser materials with a top size greater than 5 mm, an extensive investigation for adoption and improvement is required . . 3 The transportable moisture limit (TML) of a cargo is taken as equal to the critical moisture content at 70¬∞~ degree of saturation according to the Proctor/Fagerberg method test. 1.3.2 Proctor/Fagerberg test equipment 468 .1 The Proctor apparatus (see figure 1.3.2) consists of a cylindrical iron mould with a removable extension piece (the compaction cylinder) and a compaction tool guided by a pipe open at its lower end (the compaction hammer). . 2 Scales and weights (see 3.2) and suitable sample containers . . 3 A drying oven with a controlled temperature interval from 100¬∞C to maximum 105¬∞C. This oven should be without air circulation . .4 A suitable mixer.

Laboratory test procedures, associated apparatus and standards 1.3.3 Temperature and humidity (see 1.1.3) 1.3.4 Procedure .1 Establishment of a complete compaction curve. A representative sample according to a relevant standard (see 4.7 of this Code) of the test material is dried at a temperature of approximately 100¬∞C. The total quantity of the test material should be at least three times as big as required for the complete test sequence. Compaction tests are executed for 5 to 10 different moisture contents (5 to 10 separate tests). The samples are adjusted in order that dry to almost saturated (plastic) san~ples are obtained. The required quantity per compaction test is about 2,000 cm 3‚Ä¢ At each compaction test, a suitable amount of water is added to the sample of the dried test material and mixed thoroughly for 5 minutes. Approximately one fifth of the mixed sample is filled into the mould and levelled and then the increment is tamped uniformly over the surface of the increment. Tamping is executed by dropping the hammer 25 times through the guide pipe, 0.2 m each time. The performance is repeated for all five layers. When the last layer has been tamped, the extension piece is removed and the sample is levelled off along the brim of the mould. When the weight of the cylinder with the tamped sample has been determined, the cylinder is emptied, the sample is dried and the weight is determined.

The representative sample for this test should not be fully dried, except in case of moisture content measurement. IMSBC CODE (Amendment 06-21) and supplement 2022 EDITION 471

Appendix 2 472 The total quantity of the test material should be at least three times as big as required for the complete test sequence. Compaction tests are executed for 5 to 10 different moisture contents (5 to 10 separate tests). The samples are adjusted in order that partially dry to almost saturated samples are obtained. The required quantity per compaction test is about 2,000 cm 3‚Ä¢ At each compaction test a suitable amount of water is added to the sample of the test material. The sample material is gently mixed before being allowed to rest and equilibrate. Approximately one fifth of the mixed sample is filled into the mould and levelled and then the increment is tamped uniformly over the surface of the increment. Tamping is executed by dropping a 150 g hammer 25 times through the guide pipe, 0.15 m each time. The performance is repeated for all five layers. When the last layer has been tamped, the extension piece is removed and the sample is le~elled off along the brim of the mould with care, ensuring to remove any large particles that may hinder levelling of the sample, replacing them with material contained in the extension piece and re-levelling. When the weight of the cylinder with the tamped sample has been determined, the cylinder is emptied, the sample is dried at 105¬∞( and the weight is determined. Reference is made to ISO 3087:2011 "Iron ores - Determination of the moisture content of a lot". The test then is repeated for the other samples with different moisture contents. Density of solid material should be measured using a gas or water pycnometry equipment according to internationally or nationally accepted standard, e.g. ASTM D5550 and AS 1289 (see 1.4.2.5). . 2 Definitions and data for calculations (see figure 1.4.2) - empty cylinder, mass in grams: A - cylinder with tamped sample, mass in grams: B - wet sample, mass in grams: C C=B-A - dry sample, mass in grams: 0 - water, mass in grams (equivalent to volume in cm 3): E E=C-0 Volume of cylinder: 1,000 cm 3 Air Water volume Figure 1.4.2 .3 Calculation of main characteristics - density of solid material, g/cm 3 (Um3): d - dry bulk density, g/cm 3 (Um3): 1 D 1 = 1,000 - net water content, volume %: ev _E d ev- DX 100 X Weight IMSBC CODE (Amendment 06-21) and supplement 2022 EDITION

The critical moisture content is indicated by the intersection of the compaction curve and the line 5 = 80% degree of saturation. The transportable moisture limit (TML) is the critical moisture content. Optimum moisture content (OMC) is the moisture content corresponding to the maximum compaction (maximum dry density) under the specified compaction condition. To check the applicability of this test, the relationship between moisture content and dry density should be evaluated, during this test. Then the OMC and the corresponding degree of saturation should be determined. This test procedure was developed based on the finding that the degree of saturation corresponding to OMC of iron ore fines was 90 to 95%, while such degree of saturation of mineral concentrates was 70% to 75%. In the case that the degree of saturation corresponding to OMC is less than 90%, the shipper should consult with an appropriate authority, for the reason that this test may not be applicable for the material and the TML determined by this test may be too high.

Appendix 2 1.5 Modified Proctor/Fagerberg test procedure for coal 1.5.1 Scope This procedure details the laboratory determination of transportable moisture limit (TML) for coals up to a nominal top size of 50 mm. The procedure is based on a modification of the Proctor/ Fagerberg test described in 1.3 of this appendix. Key modifications to the original test procedure contained in 1.3 of this appendix are: .1 Sample preparation to facilitate the testing of O x 50 mm coal through reconstitution to -25 mm; ' .2 Use of a 150 mm diameter compaction cylinder; and .3 Sample compaction using a hammer equivalent to the Proctor/Fagerberg "D" energy hammer. The transportable moisture limit is the moisture content corresponding to the intersection of the 70% degree saturation curve and the test sample compaction curve. In the case of coals where moisture freely drains from the sample such that the test sample compaction curve does not extend to or beyond 70% saturation, the test is taken to indicate a cargo where water passes through the spaces between particles and there is no increase in pore water pressure. Therefore, the cargo is not liable to liquefy (see 7.2.2 of this Code). The procedure commences with a drum of coal containing a sample of not less than 170 kg delivered to the testing laboratory and terminates with the laboratory reporting the test result for the coal. Details of the sample collection process are excluded from this procedure. However, it is important that the sample accurately represents the size distribution of the cargo and reference should be made to the normative reference list below. 1.5.2 Normative references The following documents are referenced in this procedure. For dated references, only the cited edition applies. AS 1289.3.5.1:2006, Methods of testing soils for engineering purposes. Method 3.5.1: Soil classification tests - Determination of the soil particle density of a soil - Standard method; ISO 589:2008, Hard Coal - Determination of total moisture; ISO 3310-2:2013, Technical requirements and testing - Part 2: Test sieves of perforated metal plate; and ISO 13909-4:2001, Hard coal and coke - Mechanical sampling - Part 4 - Coal - Preparation of test samples. 1.5.3 Definitions 1.5.3.1 Transportable moisture limit (TML) The transportable moisture limit (TML) of a cargo which may liquefy means the maximum moisture content of the cargo which is considered safe for carriage in a ship not complying with the requirements in 7.3.2 of this Code. 1.5.3.2 Test outcomes 474 The transportable moisture limit determined by this procedure is the moisture content corresponding to the intersection of the 70% degree saturation curve and the test sample compaction curve. This is also referred to as the PFD70 value (Proctor/Fagerberg - D energy hammer - 70% saturation). IMSBC CODE (Amendment 06-21) and supplement 2022 EDITION

Laboratory test procedures, associated apparatus and standards Where moisture freely drains from the sample or the cylindrical mould at moisture content such that the test sample compaction curve does not extend to or beyond 70% saturation (as described in 1.5.5.3.4), the test is taken to indicate a cargo where water passes through the spaces between particles and there is no increase in pore water pressure. Therefore, the cargo is not liable to liquefy (see 7.2.2 of this Code). 1.5.3.3 Optimum moisture content (OMC) The optimum moisture content is the moisture content corresponding to the maximum compaction (maximum dry density) under the specified compaction condition. 1.5.3.4 Cross water content or total moisture (W 1) The moisture content of a sample is calculated as the mass of water divided by the total mass of solids plus water and is referred to as either the gross water content or the total moisture content. Gross water content is to be determined using the method for determining total moisture defined in the standard ISO 589:2008. 1.5.4 Determination of the TML of blends of two or more coals In circumstances where a shipper intends to load a cargo consisting of a blend of two or more coals, the shipper may: .1 determine the TML of the blend by direct application of the test method described within this procedure to a representative sample of the blended product; or .2 declare the TML of the blend based on TML determinations on each of the component coals: .1 where all component coals in the blend are known to be group A and B coals: .1 the blended cargo should be declared as group A and B; and .2 the TML of the blended cargo should be determined as the lowest TML value of any of the component coals. . 2 where a group A and B cargo component is blended with a coal which is designated as group B only: .1 the blended cargo should be declared as group A and B; and .2 the TML should be taken as the lowest TML of the group A and B component coals contained within the blend . . 3 where all component coals are determined to be group B only coals, the blended cargo may be declared as a group B only cargo. 1.5.5 Modified Proctor!Fagerberg test procedure for coal 1.5.5.1 Apparatus 1.5.5.1.1 Work area The work area should be located where the samples are protected from excessive temperatures, air currents and humidity variations. All samples should be stored in suitable sample containers, including plastic sample bags, and the containers should be sealed. 1.5.5.1.2 Standard sieves Square aperture laboratory sieves of 16 mm and 25 mm aperture as nominated in ISO 3310-2:2013 are required for reconstitution of the sample at 25 mm top size. A 2.36 mm sieve is required for generation of +2.36 mm and -2.36 mm fractions for particle density determination. Optionally a 2 mm sieve may be used for this purpose.

Dimensions are shown in figure 1.5.5.1.3.2 and table 1.5.6.2. Note: the compaction hammer has been modified to match the mould used. 1.5.5.1.5 Drying oven The drying oven should be ventilated, with forced circulation of air or inert gas, typically with a stainless-steel interior and capable of maintaining a temperature within the range of 105¬∞C ¬± 5¬∞C. 1.5.5.1.6 Weighing balance The weighing balance should be capable of weighing the sample and the container, as-received, with an accuracy of better than¬± 5 g. 1.5.5.1.7 Pycnometer Water pycnometry equipment is used to determine the density of the full-sized coal (non-crushed) in accordance with AS 1289.3.5.1:2006. Specific equipment required is as follows: a conical flask or density bottle of 250 ml capacity; a vacuum desiccator or other vacuum equipment; a drying oven set to 105¬∞C to 110¬∞c; balances: one with ¬±0.05 g accuracy and the second with ¬±1 g accuracy; a 0¬∞C to 100¬∞C thermometer; a 2.36 mm sieve (as noted in 1.5.5.1.2) a vacuum source; a water bath set at 60¬∞C; distilled, demineralized or deionized water; a wash bottle containing water; a wire basket to hold the +2.36 mm sample; a container filled with water to hold the wire basket without interference; and a scale to weigh the basket both suspended in water and drained. 1.5.5.1.8 Containers for hand mixing and sample preparation Sufficient heavy duty plastic buckets with lids of not less than 10 L capacity are required for storage and handling. Heavy duty plastic bags (200 micron thick or greater) are required for storage and hand mixing of samples. 1.5.5.1.9 Flat scraping device A thin steel scraper is required for separating the remnant sample formed in the extension piece lying above the top level of the mould. For ease of use, the scraper should have dimensions of 160 mm wide, 200 mm long and 3 mm to 5 mm thick, such as that shown in figure 1.5.5.1.9. IMSBC CODE (Amendment 06-21) and supplement 2022 EDITION 477

Appendix 2 Figure 1.5.5.1.9 - Typical scraping device 1.5.5.1.10 Drying trays Drying trays or pans should have a smooth surface, be free from contamination and heat resistant, for example stainless steel or enamel. Dimensions should be suitable to fit in the drying oven and ensure that the total sample can be contained at a loading of about 1 g/cm 2 of surface area. 1.5.5.1.11 Spray bottle A suitable plastic bottle is required to add a mist spray of water to the sample. 1.5.5.1.12 Gloves Heat resistant gloves are required for removal of hot trays and dishes. 1.5.5.1.13 Sample divider A suitable sample divider as specified in ISO 13909-4:2001 is required for subsampling the primary sample and blending the reconstituted sample for testing. 1.5.5.2 Sampling and sample preparation 1.5.5.2.1 General This procedure commences with receipt of sample of not less than 170 kg, sealed in a heavy duty (200 micron thick) plastic bag and contained in a suitable drum (e.g. 220 L). This packaging ensures the sample does not dry prior to TML determination. 1.5.5.2.2 Sample preparation Representative samples are required that have been obtained using ISO 13909-4:2001 and if required may be partially air dried or partially dried at a temperature of 40¬∞C or less to reduce the water content to a starting point suitable for dry sieving the coal with minimal fines adhering to the oversize fraction. For this purpose, samples should not be dried below 6% total moisture. The representative subsamples for the test should not be fully dried, except in the case of gross water content determination. 1.5.5.2.2.1 Sample homogenization and division Take the as-received sample and divide into individual subsamples using a sample dividing apparatus as specified in ISO 13909-4:2001. Place these subsamples into heavy duty plastic bags. 1.5.5.2.2.2 Reconstituted sample preparation procedure 478 When the sample contains particles above 25 mm, the reconstitution process below should be applied. IMSBC CODE (Amendment 06-21) and supplement 2022 EDITION

Laboratory test procedures, associated apparatus and standards In this process, particles above 25 mm are removed from the sample and replaced by an equivalent mass of particles in the range 16 mm to 25 mm. Through this process a final reconstituted sample of sufficient mass for TML testing is generated which contains a maximum particle size of 25 mm. One of two methods may be selected to generate the reconstituted sample: .1 Split the entire as-received sample and then reconstitute; or .2 Scalping off particles above 25 mm and substituting particles between 16 mm and 25 mm from a separate subsample. Method 1 Splitting tlte full as-received sample and reconstitution Step 1 Take the full as-received sample. Step 2 Screen at 25 mm, 16 mm and 2.36 mm. If a 2.36 mm screen is not available, a 2 mm screen may be used. Step 3 Weigh each of the four size fractions and calculate the percentage represented by each size fraction. Step 4 Subdivide from each size fraction below 25 mm the required mass to create a 25 kg reconstituted sample using the sample size components specified in table 1.5.5.2.2.2.1. Step 5 Combine each size fraction. Step 6 Fully mix the reconstituted sample. Step 7 Split the sample into approximately eight representative subsamples and place each into a heavy duty plastic bag. These bags now contain the sample for Proctor/Fagerberg testing. Step 8 A sample of particles passing a 2.36 mm screen (or 2 mm if 2.36 mm is not available) is required for particle density pycnometry. Method 2 Table 1.5.5.2.2.2.1 - Reconstitution size proportions (method 1) Size fraction Quantity -2.36 mm (or -2 mm) percentage of this fraction in the original sample 2.36 mm (or 2 mm) to 16 mm percentage of this fraction 16 mm to25 mm percentage of this fraction plus the percentage of +25 mm coal Scalping particles above 25 mm and replacement with 16 mm to 25 mm particles This method is described in figure 1.5.5.2.2.2 and table 1.5.5.2.2.2.2. The reconstitution process commences where the coal is initially sieved into particle sizes larger than 25 mm and smaller than 25 mm. Coal particles in the size range of 16 mm to 25 mm are extracted from separate subsamples and reconstituted back into the original -25 mm screened coal based on a mass equivalent to the +25 mm sized coal removed from the initial sample to provide a final reconstituted sample of sufficient mass for TML testing.

These now become the test portions used for Proctor/Fagerberg testing. Discard the +25 mm and -16 mm coal. 1.5.5.2.3 Initial moisture Initial moisture is to be determined on a test portion from table 1.5.5.2.2.2.2 step 5 using the method provided in ISO 589:2008. This moisture value provides a guide to the moisture steps required to develop the Proctor/Fagerberg compaction curve. 1.5.5.2.4 Particle density measurement (80 In accordance with water pycnometer standard AS 1289.3.5.1:2006, measure the density of solids on the full-size range (non-crushed) coal. The density of solids is used for determining the void ratio for plotting compaction curves. The recommended methodology is described below: .1 Generate a full particle size sample of approximately 10 kg, weigh and then screen the entire contents at 2.36 mm.

Appendix 2 Air Water Volume Weight Figure 1.5.5.3.1 - Illustration of key variables 1.5.5.3.2 Establishment of the initial compaction point 182 The initial compaction point is obtained using the first test portion of the reconstituted material at the initial moisture content. For each compaction point determination, all steps in the procedure from packing the mould to weighing the mould and sample are to be completed at the same time without breaks. In any case, coal should not be left in the mould for longer than 30 minutes prior to weighing. The test procedure is as follows: Step 1 Clean the mould, collar and base plate. Inspect and clean the hammer and ensure that it moves freely in the guide tube. Step 2 Determine the mass (A) of the empty cylinder, comprising the mould plus base plate. Step 3 Assemble the mould, collar and base plate and place the assembly on a stable bench. Step 4 Place approximately 0.5 L (one fifth of the full 2.5 L) of the test portion into the mould, level, and then tamp uniformly over the surface by dropping the hammer 25 times vertically through the full height of the guide pipe, moving the guide pipe to a new position after each drop. The required pattern for even compaction of each layer in the mould is shown in figure 1.5.5.3.2. Step 5 Repeat step 4 four more times so that there are 5 layers of material in the mould. Ensure that the compacted test portion with the final layer is above the top of the compaction mould whilst the extension piece is still attached. Step 6 When the last layer has been tamped, remove the extension piece taking care not to disturb the compacted test portion inside. Level the compacted test portion to the top of the mould using the flat scraping device, ensuring that any large particles that may hinder levelling of the test portion are removed and replaced with material contained in the extension piece and re-level. If any holes in the surface are still observed after levelling, they should be manually filled with finer material contained in the extension piece. Care should be taken to avoid any further compaction of the test portion. Step 7 Determine the mass (B) of the mould and compacted coal and then calculate the mass (C) of the wet test portion using the equation: C=B-A (1) Step 8 When the weight of the cylinder with the tamped test portion has been determined, remove the test portion from the mould, determine the mass of the wet test portion (C 1) and dry the entire test portion in an oven at 105¬∞C until constant mass is achieved. After drying, determine the weight (D 1) of the dried test portion and then calculate the percentage gross water content (W 1) as follows: w 1 = (C 1 - 0 1 )!c 1 x 100% (2) IMSBC CODE (Amendment 06-21) and supplement 2022 EDITION

Coal from a previously compacted test portion should not be reused. 7th ..---6th Figure 1.5.5.3.2 - Recommended compaction patterns 1.5.5.3.3 Establishment of complete compaction curve The range of water contents should be adjusted so that partially dry to almost saturated test portions are obtained. Care should be taken to follow the precaution in 1.5.5.3.2 above regarding prompt completion of each point in the compaction curve. The test procedure is as follows: Step 1 For each compaction test, a predetermined amount of water is added to the test portion (approximately 2.5 kg) in a heavy duty plastic bag. The water quantity added is that required to increase the moisture content to the target value for the next test. The water should be added as a mist spray to the surface of the individual test portions. The water at this point should be added slowly and in small quantities, as the introduction of large amounts of water may induce localized compaction behaviour. Step 2 After the calculated water addition, the test portion should then be mixed thoroughly in the plastic bag by sealing the bag and turning it over repeatedly for 5 min.

Appendix 2, ¬∑ Step 3 The test portion should then be allowed to equilibrate for a minimum of 12 hours prior to compaction testing. Step 4 Repeat steps 1 to 11 from 1.5.5.3.2. Step 5 Repeat the test between four and seven times using the other prepared test portions with different water contents to obtain at least five points on the compaction curve. The water contents should be chosen so that: .1 at least one point corresponds to moisture content higher than the optimum moisture content (OMC) or than the value corresponding to 70% of degree of saturation (5), in orde[ to satisfactorily define the compaction curve; and .2 at least one point corresponds to the degree of saturation (5) between 70% and 80%, in order to effectively assess the PFD70 value. A point close to a degree of saturation (5) of 80% will also assist accurate assessment if the OMC is greater than 70%. 1.5.5.3.4 Visual appearance of coal in the cylindrical mould In order for the test to obtain a PFD70 value, all tests conducted at or below the PFD70 moisture value should have an even moisture distribution throughout the cylindrical mould. Two examples of tests using samples of the same coal at different moisture contents are shown in figure 1.5.5.3.4.1. The left-hand photograph shows a coal specimen at a relatively low degree of saturation. Note that the coal remains in place following removal of the collar. The right-hand photograph shows a specimen near or possibly above 70% degree of saturation. Once again the coal remains in place following removal of the collar. Both tests provided valid points on the compaction curve. Figure 1.5.5.3.4.1 - Photographs showing valid tests for a partially saturated test portion (left) and a near fully saturated test portion (right) Coals where water passes through the spaces between particles exhibit moisture migration within the Proctor/Fagerberg cylindrical mould. Moisture migration may take place when the degree of saturation of the specimen is less than 70%. IMSBC CODE (Amendment 06-21) and supplement 2022 EDITION

Laboratory test procedures, associated apparatus and standards Evidence of moisture migration is from visual observation at the completion of each test as follows: .1 moisture leakage from the base of the mould is evident as shown in figure 1.5.5.3.4.2; and .2 the portion above the top of the cylindrical mould appears unsaturated and the test portion maintains its structure without deformation or movement. In this case, moisture migration has occurred and hence for this coal water passes through the spaces between particles. Moisture leaking at base Non-saturated top Moisture leaking at base Figure 1.5.5.3.4.2 - Test showing water leakage from the base of the cylindrical mould indicating moisture migration 1.5.5.3.5 Calculation of key parameters for determination of compaction curve Carry out the following calculations for each compaction test: d = density of solids, g/cm 3 (t/m 3) by pycnometry (see 1.5.5.2.4) , = dry bulk density, g/cm 3 (t/m 3) = DIV ev = net water content (percentage by volume) = (EID) X 700 X dlpw where Pw = density of water, g/cm 3 (t/m 3) e = void ratio (volume of voids divided by volume of solids) = (di,) - 1 5 = degree of saturation (percentage by volume) = e/e W 1 = gross (total) water content (percentage by mass) (see 1.5.5.3.2, step 8). 1.5.5.3.6 Presentation of compaction results Record all the compaction test results in a suitable spreadsheet (such as that shown in table 1.5.6.1) and from this spreadsheet create a compaction curve as shown in figure 1.5.5.3.6 by plotting the calculated void ratio (e) for each compaction test on the ordinate against either the net or gross water content plotted on the abscissa. IMSBC CODE (Amendment 06-21) and supplement 2022 EDITION 485

Appendix 2 The lines in figure 1.5.5.3.6 correspond to plots of void ratio (e) versus net water content (ey) at 20%, 40%, 60%, 70%, 80% and 100% degree of saturation (5). These lines are calculated at five values of void ratio using the formulae in 1.5.5.3.7. Note: These lines corresponding to degree of saturation will be curved in the case of plotting gross water content on the abscissa.

The preferred approach to presenting the results is to plot the void ratio (e) against the gross water content (W 1) allowing moisture for any saturation level to be read directly from the plot as gross water content. This approach is shown in figure 1.5.5.3.7. The saturation lines are plotted according to the equation: e = W 1 /(100 - W 1) x 100 x d/5 The intercept of the compaction curve with the 70% degree of saturation line in figure 1.5.5.3.7 occurs at a gross water content of 15.4%, which is the transportable moisture limit (TML). For this example, the optimum moisture content (OMC) occurs at a degree of saturation of about 85%. 1.5.5.3.8 Determination of transportable moisture limit 1.5.5.3.8.1 Determination of PFD70 moisture content 486 The PFD70 value is determined as the gross (total) water content corresponding to the intersection of the compaction curve and the line 5 = 70% saturation. The optimum moisture content (OMC) is the gross (total) moisture content corresponding to the maximum compaction (maximum dry density and minimum void ratio) under the specified compaction condition. The test procedure is applicable for determination of coal TML where the degree of saturation corresponding to the OMC of the coal is at or greater than 70%. Where the OMC lies below 70% degree of saturation, this test is not applicable for the specific coal and the PFD70 may overstate the TML. In such cases, the certificate of analysis should state that the OMC is below 70% saturation and the shipper should consult with an appropriate authority.

Place these subsamples into heavy duty plastic buckets that can be sealed to preserve water content. .3 Reconstituted sample preparation procedure Reconstitution is required for bauxites if the amount of material in the representative sample that is coarser than 25 mm is greater than 10% of the total mass (by dry weight). In this case the reconstitution process below should be applied (see also figure 1.6.4.3). In this process, particles above 25 mm are removed from the sample and replaced by an equivalent mass of particles in the range 6.3 mm to 25 mm. Note that 6.3 mm is a standard sieve size. If it is not IMSBC CODE (Amendment 06-21) and supplement 2022 EDITION

Laboratory test procedures, associated apparatus and standards available, a 6 mm sieve may be used instead. Through reconstitution, a final reconstituted sample of sufficient mass for TML testing is generated which contains a maximum particle size of 25 mm, but which better reproduces the compaction characteristics of the full as-received particle size distribution with particles greater than 25 mm. Step 1 Step 2 Step 3 Sample 1 ~50 kg Sample 2 ~30 kg 25mm sieving 25mm and 6.3mm sieving Discard material ~10 kg D>25mm ~40 kg D > 25 mm Discard material ~6kg D>25mm Replacement material for reconstitution ~10 kg 25 mm> D > 6.3 mm Discard material ~14 kg D>6.3mm Reconstituted sample for testing ~50 kg Figure 1.6.4.3 - Schematic diagram of reconstitution sample procedure The first step in sample preparation is to sieve the sample at 25 mm to determine the amount of dry weight that is larger than 25 mm. All material retained on the 25 mm sieve is to be discarded, while material passing 25 mm is to be tested (see figure 1.6.4.3). Screen about 40 kg of bauxite for one Proctor/Fagerberg compaction curve if reconstitution is required. If the amount (by dry weight) that is larger than 25 mm is 10% or less, then no reconstitution is required. A total of about 50 kg of 25 mm screened bauxite is needed for one Proctor/Fagerberg compaction curve. Obtain this and proceed to Step 4 if no reconstitution is required. If reconstitution is required, then from a separate representative sub sample of the same ore screen at 25 mm and 6.3 mm and retain the portion between these two sieve sizes. Produce about 15 kg of screened bauxite between these two sizes for one Proctor/ Fagerberg compaction curve (see figure 1.6.4.3). Add the 6.3 to 25 mm fraction from Step 2 to the <25 mm fraction from Step 1. The amount of 6.3 mm to 25 mm fraction added must be equal to the mass of > 25 mm bauxite removed and discarded in Step 1. Step 4 Fully mix the reconstituted or scalped sample. .4 Compaction Compaction tests are executed for 5 to 10 (but typically 7) different moisture contents in separate tests. The number of tests should fully define the compaction curve, including accurately determining the optimum moisture content and conditions near to or at full IMSBC CODE (Amendment 06-21) and supplement 2022 EDITION 491

Appendix 2 492 saturation. A total of about 40 kg to 100 kg of unscreened bauxite is typically needed for one series of tests, depending on whether reconstitution is required or not. Divide the screened bauxite into 5 to 10 subsamples and place each in a sealed plastic bucket. The water content of the subsamples is adjusted by adding a suitable amount of water into each bucket in order to obtain water contents ranging from the as-received water content to almost saturated sub samples. Typically one test is carried out at the as-received water content. Four to eight tests are carried out at higher water contents. Depending on the as-received water content, one or two tests are carried out at lower water contents than the as-received water content. These lower water content tests -are obtained by partially drying the bauxite subsample at room temperature. Note that full drying of the bauxite samples is not to be carried out. Note that some bauxites are not sensitive to pre-drying, but unless this is comprehensively demonstrated for the bauxite being tested, pre-drying is not permitted. The subsamples are mixed at the target water contents before being allowed to rest and equilibrate overnight in the sealed plastic buckets. The plastic bucket contents are remixed immediately before compaction to ensure that a homogeneous sample is tested. The required quantity of prepared bauxite per compaction test is about 5 kg, so this is the target amount for each subsample. The subsamples will be compacted at the prepared water contents to define a full compaction curve. Approximately one fifth of the subsample in a plastic bucket is filled into the mould with the extension piece attached (figure 1.6.2) and levelled to form the first layer increment. Bauxites that display plasticity may tend to stick together into clumps at the wetter water contents. It is important to gently disaggregate the clumps by hand into small particles when loading the mould. The bauxite is then tamped uniformly over the surface of the layer. Tamping is executed as per the Proctor/Fagerberg method 0, by dropping a 150 g hammer 58 times through the guide pipe, 0.15 m each time. The guide tube is held by hand and positioned so that it is just touching with the surface of the ore, but is not resting on it. This allows the hammer to fall the full specified height and compact the bauxite, while avoiding additional (and excessive) compaction arising from the weight of the guide tube, itself, which should not be compressing the bauxite. The performance is repeated for all five layers so that the last layer only just overfills the mould-extension piece junction. The aim is to fill the mould by compacting in five nearly equal layers in order to produce a uniformly compacted sample in which the specified energy has been put into bauxite that occupies the mould volume. Bauxite should not extend more than 1 cm in height above the mould into the extension piece. If a height of more than 1 cm of bauxite is found, the sample has been under compacted and the test should be redone. When the last layer has been tamped, the extension piece is removed and the sample is levelled off along the brim of the mould with care, ensuring to remove any large particles that may hinder levelling of the sample, replacing them with material contained in the extension piece and re-levelling. The levelling process should be a horizontal cutting action, not a pushing action as that would compress more material into the mould volume than had been compacted by the specified energy input. After the weight of the cylinder with the tamped sample has been determined, the cylinder is emptied, the full sample is dried at 105¬∞C as per ISO moisture determination standard for bauxite (ISO 9033:1989 "Aluminium ores -Determination of the moisture content of bulk material") and the weight is determined. The test is then repeated for the other samples with different moisture contents. IMSBC CODE (Amendment 06-21) and supplement 2022 EDITION

Should the optimum moisture content (OMC) of bauxite occur at or above 90% saturation, the critical moisture content is indicated by the intersection of the compaction curve and the line 5 = 80% degree of saturation (see figure 1.6.4.7.1). The TML is the critical moisture content. IMSBC CODE (Amendment 06-21) and supplement 2022 EDITION

Laboratory test procedures, associated apparatus and standards Should the optimum moisture content (OMC) of bauxite occur below 90% saturation, the critical moisture content is indicated by the intersection of the compaction curve and the line 5 = 70% degree of saturation (see figure 1.6.4.7.2). The TML is the critical moisture content. Where the OMC is not clearly defined by carrying out a sufficient number of tests at water contents close to on either side of the OMC, then a TML based on 5 = 80% cannot be adopted. The TML shall be based on 5 = 70%. This is to guard against the erroneous adoption of a high OMC due to insufficient definition of the compaction curve. Where moisture very freely drains from the sample at moisture content such that the test sample compaction curve does not extend to or beyond 70% saturation, the test is taken to indicate a cargo where water passes freely through the spaces between particles. 2 Test procedures to determine the angle of repose and associated apparatus 2.1 Determination of angle of repose of fine-grained materials (size less than 10 mm): "tilting box test". For use in laboratory or port of loading 2.1.1 Scope The test provides for the determination of the angle of repose of fine-grained non-cohesive materials (size less than 10 mm). The results so obtained may be used when interpreting sections 5 and 6 of this Code for the materials in question. 2.1.2 Definition The angle of repose obtained by this test is the angle formed between the horizontal and the top of the testbox when the material in the box just begins to slide in bulk. 2.1.3 Principle of test When measuring the angle of repose by this method, the material surface should initially be level and parallel to the testbox base. The box is tilted without vibration and tilting is stopped when the product just begins to slide in bulk. 2.1.4 Apparatus (see figure 2.1.4) Apparatus is as follows: .1 A framework, on top of which is attached an open box. Attachment of the box to the frame is by means of a shaft passing through bearings affixed to both the frame and the end of the box, enabling the box to be subjected to a controlled tilt. .2 The dimensions of the box are 600 mm long, 400 mm wide and 200 mm high . .3 To prevent sliding of the material along the bottom of the box during tilting, a tightly fitting grating (openings 30 mm x 30 mm x 25 mm) is placed on the bottom of the box before filling . .4 Tilting of the box is effected by a hydraulic cylinder fitted between the frame and the bottom of the box. Other means may be used to obtain the required tilting but in all cases vibration must be eliminated . ‚Ä¢5 To pressurize the hydraulic cylinder, a hydropneumatic accumulator may be used, pressurized by air or gas at a pressure of about 5 kp/cm 2 ‚Ä¢ .6 The rate of tilting should be approximately 0.3¬∞/s . ‚Ä¢7 Range of tilt should be at least 50¬∞. .8 A protractor is fitted to the end of the shaft. One lever of the protractor is fitted so that it may be screw-adjusted to the horizontal. IMSBC CODE (Amendment 06-21) and supplement 2022 EDITION 495

The excess material is scraped off with the aid of a straight edge, inclined at about 45¬∞ towards the direction of scraping. The tilting system is then activated and stopped when the material just begins to slide in bulk. The angle of the top of the box to the horizontal is measured by the protractor and recorded.

Laboratory test procedures, associated apparatus and standards 2.1.6 Evaluation The angle of repose is calculated as the mean of three measurements and is reported to within half a degree. Notes: Preferably the test should be carried out with three independent samples. Care should be taken to ensure that the shaft is adjusted to be horizontal before testing. 2.2 Alternative or shipboard test method to be used for the determination of the angle of repose when the tilting box is not available 2.2.1 Definition According to this method, the angle of repose is the angle between the cone slope and the horizontal measured at half height. 2.2.2 Principle of test To determine the angle of repose, a quantity of the material to be tested is poured very carefully out of a flask onto a sheet of rough-textured paper, in such a way that a symmetrical cone is formed. 2.2.3 Equipment The necessary equipment to carry out this test is as follows: a horizontal table free from vibrations; a sheet of rough-textured paper onto which the material should be poured; a protractor; and a 3-L conical flask. 2.2.4 Procedure Put the sheet of paper on the table. Split 10 L of the material to be tested into three subsamples and test each in the following way: Pour two thirds of the subsample (i.e. 2 L) onto the sheet, producing a starting cone. The remainder of this subsample is then poured very carefully from a height of a few millimetres on top of the cone. Care should be taken that the cone will be built up symmetrically. This may be achieved by revolving the flask slowly close around the top of the cone when pouring. When measuring, care should be taken that the protractor does not touch the cone; otherwise this may result in sliding of the material and spoil the test. The angle has to be measured at four places around the cone, about 90 degrees apart. This test should be repeated on the other two subsamples. 2.2.5 Calculations The angle of repose is taken as the mean of the 12 measurements and is reported to half a degree. This figure can be converted to the tilting box value as follows: (2.2.5) where at= angle of repose according to the tilting box test a 5 = angle of repose according to the survey test IMSBC CODE (Amendment 06-21) and supplement 2022 EDITION 497

Appendix 2 3.1.2 Flow table mounting 3.1.2.1 The flow table frame shall be tightly bolted to a cast iron or steel plate at least 1 inch (25 mm) thick and 10 inches (250 mm) square. The top surface of this plate shall be machined to a smooth plane surface. The plate shall be anchored to the top of a concrete pedestal by four¬Ω inch (13 mm) bolts that pass through the plate and are embedded at least 6 inches (150 mm) in the pedestal. The pedestal shall be cast inverted on the base plate. A positive contact between the base plate and the pedestal shall be obtained at all points. No nuts or other such levelling devices shall be used between the plate and the pedestal. Levelling shall be effected by suitable means under the base of the pedestal. 3.1.2.2 The pedestal shall be 10 inches to 11 inches (250 mm to 275 mm) square at the top, and 15 inches to 16 inches (375 mm to 400 mm) square at the bottom, 25 inches to 30 inches (625 mm to 750 mm) in height, and shall be of monolithic construction, cast from concrete weighing at least 140 lb/ft 3 (2,240 kg/m 3). A stable gasket cork pad,¬Ω inch (13 mm) thick and approximately 4 inches (102 mm) square, shall be inserted under each corner of the pedestal. The flow table shall be checked frequently for levelness of the table top, stability of the pedestal, and tightness of the bolts and nuts in the table base and the pedestal plate. (A torque of 20 lb/ft (27 Nm) is recommended when tightening those fastenings.) 3.1.2.3 The table top, after the frame has been mounted on the pedestal, shall be level along two diameters at right angles to each other, in both the raised and lowered positions. 3.1.3 Flow table lubrication 3.1.3.1 The vertical shaft of the table shall be kept clean and shall be lightly lubricated with a light oil (SAE-10). Oil shall not be present between the contact faces of the table top and the supporting frame. Oil on the cam face will lessen wear and promote smoothness of operation. The table should be raised and permitted to drop a dozen or more times just prior to use if it has not been operated for some time. 3.1.4 Mould 3.1.4.1 The mould for casting the flow specimen shall be of cast bronze or brass, constructed as shown in figure 3. The Rockwell hardness number of the metal shall be not less than HRB 25. The diameter of the top opening shall be 2.75 inches ¬± 0.02 inches (69.8 mm ¬± 0.5 mm) for new moulds and 2.75 inches + 0.05 inches (+ 1.3 mm) and 0.02 inches for moulds in use. The surfaces of the base and top shall be parallel and at right angles to the vertical axis of the cone. The mould shall have a minimum wall thickness of 0.2 inches (5 mm). The outside of the top edge of the mould shall be shaped so as to provide an integral collar for convenient lifting of the mould. All surfaces shall be machined to a smooth finish. A circular shield approximately 10 inches (254 mm) in diameter, with a centre opening approximately 4 inches (102 mm) in diameter, made of non-absorbing material not attacked by the cement, shall be used with the flow mould to prevent mortar from spilling on the table top. 3.2 Scales and weights* 3.2.1 Scales 3.2.1.1 The scales used shall conform to the following requirements. On scales in use, the permissible variation at a load of 2,000 g shall be¬± 2.0 g. The permissible variation on new scales shall be one half of this value. The sensibility reciprocalt shall be not greater than twice the permissible variation. ' Refer to Standard Method of Test for Compressive Strength of Hydraulic Cement Mortars, Designation C109-3.

Appendix 2 4 Trough test for determination of the self-sustainingexothermic decomposition of fertilizers containing nitrates* 4.1 Definition A fertilizer capable of self-sustaining decomposition is defined as one in which decomposition initiated in a localized area will spread throughout the mass. The tendency of a fertilizer offered for transport to undergo this type of decomposition can be determined by means of the trough test. In this test localized decomposition is initiated in a bed of the fertilizer to be contained in a horizontally mounted trough. The amount of propagation, after removal of the initiating heat source, of decomposition through the mass is measured. A Steel plate (150 x 150 mm and 1 to 3 mm thick) 8 Gas burners (e.g. Teclu or Bunsen) C Heat shield (2 mm thick) D Stand (e.g. made from 15 mm wide, 2 mm thick steel bar) E Gauze trough (150 x 150 x 500 mm) Figure 4-1 - Gauze trough with support and burners 4.2 Apparatus and materials The apparatus (figure 4-1) consists of a trough of internal dimensions 150 mm x 150 mm x 500 mm, open at the top. The trough is constructed of square-meshed gauze (preferably stainless steel) with a mesh width of about 1.5 mm and a wire thickness of 1.0 mm supported on a frame made from, for example, 15 mm wide, 2 mm thick steel bars. The gauze at each end of the trough may be replaced by 1.5 mm thick, 150 mm x 150 mm stainless steel plates. The trough should be rested on a suitable support. Fertilizers with a particle size distribution such that a significant amount falls through the mesh of the trough should be tested in a trough of smaller mesh gauze, or alternatively in a trough lined with gauze of a smaller mesh. During initiation, sufficient heat should be provided and maintained to establish a uniform decomposition front. Two alternative heating methods are recommended, namely: * Refer to section 39 of the United Nations Manual of Tests and Criteria. 502 IMSBC CODE (Amendment 06-21) and supplement 2022 EDITION

Laboratory test procedures, associated apparatus and standards 4.2.1 Electrical heating An electrical heating element (capacity 250 W) enclosed in a stainless steel box is placed inside and at one end of the trough (figure 4-2). The dimensions of the stainless steel box are 145 mm x 145 mm x 10 mm, and the wall thickness is 3 mm. The side of the box which is not in contact with the fertilizer should be protected with a heat shield (insulation plate 5 mm thick). The heating side of the box may be protected with aluminium foil or a stainless steel plate. 4.2.2 Gas burners D A Aluminium or stainless steel sheathing (thickness 3 mm) B Insulating plate (thickness 5 mm) C Aluminium foil or stainless steel plate (thickness 3 mm) D Position of heating device in trough Figure 4-2 - Electrical heating device (capacity 250 W) A steel plate (thickness 1 mm to 3 mm) is placed inside one end of the trough and in contact with the wire gauze (figure 4-1). The plate is heated by means of two burners which are fixed to the trough support and are capable of maintaining the plate at temperatures between 400¬∞C and 600¬∞C, i.e. dull red heat. 4.2.3 To prevent heat transport along the outside of the trough, a heat shield consisting of a steel plate (2 mm thick) should be installed at about 50 mm from the end of the trough where the heating takes place. 4.2.4 The life of the apparatus may be prolonged if it is constructed of stainless steel throughout. This is particularly important in the case of the gauze trough. 4.2.5 Propagation may be measured using thermocouples in the substance and recording the time at which a sudden temperature rise occurs as the reaction front reaches the thermocouple. IMSBC CODE (Amendment 06-21) and supplement 2022 EDITION 503

Appendix 2 4.3 Procedure 4.3.1 The apparatus should be set up under a fume hood to remove toxic decomposition gases or in an open area where the fumes can be readily dispersed. Although there is no explosion risk, when performing the test it is advisable to have a protective shield, e.g. of suitable transparent plastics, between the observer and the apparatus. 4.3.2 The trough is filled with the fertilizer in the form to be offered for shipment, and decomposition is initiated at one end, either electrically or by means of gas burners as described above. Heating should be continued until decomposition of the fertilizer is well established and propagation of the front (over approxirriately 30 mm to 50 mm) has been observed. In the case of products with high thermal stability, it may be necessary to continue heating for 2 hours. If fertilizers show a tendency to melt, the heating should be done with care, i.e. using a small flame. 4.3.3 About 20 minutes after the heating has been discontinued, the position of the decomposition front is noted. The position of the reaction front can be determined by difference in colour, e.g. brown (undecomposed fertilizer) to white (decomposed fertilizer), or by the temperature indicated by adjacent pairs of thermocouples which bracket the reaction front. The rate of propagation may be determined by observation and timing or from thermocouple records. It should be noted whether there is no propagation after heating is discontinued or whether propagation occurs throughout the substance. 4.4 Test criteria and method of assessing results 4.4.1 If propagation of the decomposition continues throughout the substance, the fertilizer is considered capable of showing self-sustaining decomposition. 4.4.2 If propagation does not continue throughout the substance, the fertilizer is considered to be free from the hazard of self-sustaining decomposition. 5 Description of the test of resistance to detonation 5.1 Principle 5.1.1 The test sample is confined in a steel tube and subjected to detonation shock from an explosive booster charge. Propagation of the detonation is determined from the degree of compression of lead cylinders on which the tube rests horizontally during the test. 5.2 Sample preparation 5.2.1 The test must be carried out on a representative sample of cargo. Before being tested for resistance to detonation, the whole mass of the sample is to be thermally cycled five times between 25¬∞C and 50¬∞C (¬±1¬∞C) in sealed tubes. The sample shall be maintained at the extreme temperatures, measured at the centre of the sample, for at least 1 hour during each thermal cycle and at 20¬∞C (¬±3¬∞C) after complete cycling until tested. 5.3 Materials >04 Seamless steel tube to ISO 65-1981-Heavy or equivalent Tube length Nominal external diameter Nominal wall thickness 1,000 mm 114 mm 5 mm to 6.5 mm Bottom plate (160 mm x 160 mm) of good weldable quality steel, thickness 5 mm to 6 mm to be butt-welded to one end of the tube around the entire circumference.

Laboratory test procedures, associated apparatus and standards Initiation system and booster Electrical blasting cap or detonating cord with non-metallic sleeve (10 to 13 g/m). Compressed pellet of secondary explosive, such as hexogen/wax 95/5 or tetryl, with a central recess to take the detonator. 500 ¬± 1 gramme plastic explosive containing 83 to 86% penthrite, formed into a cylinder in a cardboard or plastic tube. Detonation velocity 7,300-7,700 mis. Six witness cylinders of refined, cast lead for detecting detonation 50 mm diameter x 100 mm high, refined lead of at least 99.5% purity. 5.4 Procedure Test temperature: 15 to 20¬∞C. Figures 5-1 and 5-2 show the test arrangement. Fill the tube about one-third of its height with the test sample and drop it 10 cm vertically five times on the floor. Improve the compression by striking the side wall with a hammer between drops. A further addition shall be made such that, after compaction or by raising and dropping the tube 20 times and a total of 20 intermittent hammer blows, the charge fills the tube to a distance of 70 mm from its orifice. Insert the plastic explosive into the tube and press it down with a wooden die. Place the compressed pellet centrally in the recess within the plastic explosive. Close it with a wooden disc so that it remains in contact with the test sample. Lay the test tube horizontally on the 6 lead cylinders placed at 150 mm intervals (centric), with the centre of the last cylinder 75 mm from the bottom plate, on a firm, level, solid surface that is resistant to deformation or displacement. Insert the electrical blasting cap or the detonating cord. Ensure that all necessary safety precautions are taken, connect and detonate the explosive. Record, for each of the lead cylinders, the degree of compression expressed as a percentage of the original height of 100 mm. For oblique compression, the deformation is taken as the average of the maximum and minimum deformation. 5.5 Results The test is to be carried out twice. If in each test one or more of the supporting lead cylinders are crushed by less than 5%, the sample is deemed to satisfy the resistance to detonation requirements.

Foreword The safety of bulk carriers is one of the most important issues that IMO has addressed in recent years and, as a result, a number of safety measures, covering both structural and operational aspects of such ships, have been recently introduced by the Organization. The Code of Practice for the Safe Loading and Unloading of Bulk Carriers (BLU Code) is one such measure. Being concerned about the continued loss of ships carrying solid bulk cargoes, sometimes without a trace, and the heavy loss of life incurred, and recognizing that a number of accidents have occurred as a result of improper loading and unloading of bulk carriers, the Sub-Committee on Dangerous Goods, Solid Cargoes and Containers (DSC) at its first session (February 1996) developed a draft code of practice for the safe loading and unloading of bulk carriers, with the aim of preventing such accidents. The Code was reviewed by the Maritime Safety Committee (MSC) at its sixty-sixth session (June 1996) and by the DSC at its second session (February 1997), and was subsequently approved by the MSC at its sixty-eighth session (June 1997); finally, it was adopted by the Assembly at its twentieth session (November 1997) by resolution A.862(20). In adopting the resolution, the Assembly urged Governments to implement the BLU Code at the earliest possible opportunity, and to inform IMO of any non-compliance. It further urged Governments in whose territories solid bulk cargo loading and unloading terminals are situated to introduce port by-laws as follows: - terminal operators are required to comply with the relevant IMO codes and recommendations on ship/port cooperation; - terminal operators are required to appoint a "terminal representative" as stipulated in section 1.6 of the annex to resolution A.797(19); - the master is responsible at all times for the safe loading and unloading of the ship, the details of which should be confirmed with the terminal operator in the form of an agreed loading or unloading plan; - in case of non-compliance with the agreed loading or unloading plans or any other situation which endangers the safety of the ship, the master has the right to stop the loading or unloading; and - port authorities have the right to stop the loading or unloading of solid bulk cargoes when the safety of the ship carrying such cargoes is endangered. The BLU Code, which provides guidance to ship masters of bulk carriers, terminal operators and other parties concerned for the safe handling, loading and unloading of solid bulk cargoes, is also linked to regulation Vl/7 (Loading, unloading and stowage of bulk cargoes) of the 1974 SOLAS Convention, as amended by resolution MSC.47(66). Further amendments to the BLU Code were adopted by the Maritime Safety Committee at its eighty-second and eighty-seventh sessions by resolutions MSC.238(82) and MSC.304(87), respectively. The Maritime Safety Committee, at its eightieth session (11 to 20 May 2005), approved the Manual on loading and unloading of solid bulk cargoes for terminal representatives and agreed that the application of the guidance contained therein would address the concerns on risk control options and urged Member Governments, shipowners, ship operators and terminals to apply the guidance contained therein. Amendments to the BLU Manual were approved by the Maritime Safety Committee at its eighty-seventh session, MSC.1/Circ.1356 refers. IMSBC CODE (Amendment 06-21) and supplement 2022 EDITION 543

BLU Code The Maritime Safety Committee recognized the need to provide further guidance to supplement the Code of Practice for the Safe Loading and Unloading of Bulk Carriers (BLU Code) and agreed to the Additional considerations for the safe loading of bulk carriers, MSC.1/Circ.1357 refers. The provisions of the Code should be applied with due regard to the provisions of the International Maritime Solid Bulk Cargoes Code (IMSBC Code) where applicable. 544 IMSBC CODE (Amendment 06-21) and supplement 2022 EDITION

Resolution A.862(20)* adopted on 27 November 1997 Code of Practice for the Safe Loading and Unloading of Bulk Carriers THE ASSEMBLY, RECALLING Article 15(j) of the Convention on the International Maritime Organization concerning the functions of the Assembly in relation to regulations and guidelines concerning maritime safety, RECALLING FURTHER that, by resolutions A.713(17) and A.797(19), it adopted measures to improve the safety of ships carrying solid bulk cargoes, RECALLING ALSO that, in adopting resolution A.797(19), it requested the Maritime Safety Committee (MSC) to carry out, with high priority, its work on the safety of ships carrying solid bulk cargoes and to develop, as soon as possible, requirements and recommendations covering survivability standards, design and construction standards, management and training, operational standards, survey requirements and ship/shore interface aspects, NOTING that, by resolution MSC.47(66), the MSC, at its sixty-sixth session, adopted amendments to the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS), 1974, to include a revised regulation 7 of chapter VI dealing with loading and unloading of bulk cargo, NOTING FURTHER the approval by the MSC, at its sixty-sixth session, of MSC/Circ.743 on communications between maritime administrations and port authorities, whereby Governments in whose territories solid bulk cargo loading and unloading terminals are situated are invited to introduce port by-laws complying with operative paragraph 5 of that circular, BEING CONCERNED at the continued loss of ships carrying solid bulk cargoes, sometimes without a trace, and the heavy loss of life incurred, BEARING IN MIND that a number of accidents have occurred as a result of improper loading and unloading of bulk carriers and that the development of safe loading and unloading practices can prevent such accidents occurring in the future, RECOGNIZING the need to improve the safe loading and unloading of bulk carriers, RECOGNIZING FURTHER that such improvement could be achieved by the establishment of a composite code of practice for the safe loading and unloading of bulk carriers, BELIEVING that the application of such a code of safe practice would enhance maritime safety, HAVING CONSIDERED the recommendation made by the MSC at its sixty-sixth and sixty-eighth sessions, 1. ADOPTS the Code of Practice for the Safe Loading and Unloading of Bulk Carriers, set out in the annex to the present resolution; 2. URGES Governments to implement this Code at the earliest possible opportunity and to inform IMO of any non-compliance; * As amended by resolution MSC.238(82). IMSBC CODE (Amendment 06-21) and supplement 2022 EDITION 545

~U Code FURTHER URGES Governments in whose territories solid bulk cargo loading and unloading terminals are tuated, to introduce port by-laws to the effect that: 46 .1 terminal operators are required to comply with the relevant IMO codes and recommendations on ship/port cooperation; .2 terminal operators are required to appoint a "terminal representative" as stipulated in section 1.6 of the annex to resolution A.797(19); .3 the master is responsible at all times for the safe loading and unloading of the ship, the details of which should be confirmed with the terminal operator in the form of an agreed loading or unloading plan; .4 in case of non-cempliance with the agreed loading or unloading plans or any other situation which endangers the safety of the ship, the master has the right to stop the loading or unloading; and .5 port authorities have the right to stop the loading or unloading of solid bulk cargoes when the safety of the ship carrying such cargoes is endangered. REQUESTS the MSC to keep this Code under review and to amend it, as necessary; REVOKES MSC/Circ.690 and DSC/Circ.3. IMSBC CODE (Amendment 06-21) and supplement 2022 EDITION

Code of Practice for the Safe Loading and Unloading of Bulk Carriers Introduction 1 This Code of Practice for the Safe Loading and Unloading of Bulk Carriers* has been developed by the International Maritime Organization to minimize losses of bulk carriers. 2 The purpose of the Code is to assist persons responsible for the safe loading or unloading of bulk carriers to carry out their functions and to promote the safety of bulk carriers. 3 The Code primarily covers the safety of ships loading and unloading solid bulk cargoes and reflects current issues, best practices and legislative requirements. Broader safety and pollution issues such as those covered by the SOLAS, MARPOL and Load Line Conventions are not specifically included in the Code. 4 The recommendations in this Code provide guidance to shipowners, masters, shippers, operators of bulk carriers, charterers and terminal operators for the safe handling, loading, and unloading of solid bulk cargoes. The recommendations are subject to terminal and port requirements, or national regulations. Persons responsible for the loading or unloading of bulk carriers should also be aware of such regulations and requirements. 5 Masters and terminals loading and unloading solid bulk cargoes possessing chemical hazards should also refer to SOLAS chapters 11-2 and Vil and to MSC/Circ.675 (Recommendations on the safe transport of dangerous cargoes and related activities in port areas).t 6 The requirements of individual terminals and port authorities should be published in terminal and port information books. The type of information usually given in these books is listed in appendix 1. The books should be given to the masters of ships where possible before or on arrival at a port or terminal. 7 It is recommended that a copy of this Code be made available to every ship, charterer and bulk loading or unloading terminal so that advice on operational procedures is readily available and respective responsibilities are identified. 8 In the event of a conflict between this Code and the International Code for the Safe Carriage of Grain in Bulk (International Grain Code), the provisions of the International Grain Code should prevail. Section 1 Definitions For the purpose of the Code the following definitions apply: 1.1 Air draught means the vertical distance from the surface of the water to the highest point of mast or aerial. * The Code of Safe Practice for the Safe Loading and Unloading of Bulk Carriers comprises the annex to resolution A.862(20). t MSC/Circ.675 has been revoked by MSC.1/Circ.1216, Revised recommendations on the safe transport of dangerous cargoes and related activities in port areas. IMSBC CODE (Amendment 06-21) and supplement 2022 EDITION 547

~u Code 2 Bulk Cargo Shipping Name (BCSN) identifies a bulk cargo during transport by sea. When a cargo is listed in the IMSBC Code, the Bulk Cargo Shipping Name of the cargo is identified by capital letters in the individual schedules or in the index. When the cargo is a dangerous good, as defined in the International Maritime Dangerous Goods (IMDG) Code, as defined in regulation Vll/1.1 of the SOLAS Convention, the Proper Shipping Name of that cargo is the Bulk Cargo Shipping Name. 3 Combination carriers (080 or 0/0) means a ship whose design is similar to a conventional bulk carrier but is equipped with pipelines, pumps and inert gas plant so as to enable the carriage of oil cargoes in designated spaces . .4 Conveyor system means the entire system for delivering cargo from the shore stockpile or receiving point to the ship. ¬∑ .5 Hot work means the use of open fires and flames, power tools or hot rivets, grinding, soldering, burning, cutting, welding or any other repair work involving heat or creating sparks which may lead to a hazard because of the presence or proximity of flammable atmosphere . .6 IMSBC Code means the International Maritime Solid Bulk Cargoes Code as defined in regulation Vl/1.1 of the SOLAS Convention . .7 List indication lights means lights, visible from the deck, which light up to show that a ship is listing . .8 Master means the master of the ship or a ship's officer designated by the master. .9 Pour means the quantity of cargo poured through one hatch opening as one step in the loading plan, i.e. from the time the spout is positioned over a hatch opening until it is moved to another hatch opening . .10 Solid bulk cargo means any cargo, other than a liquid or a gas, consisting of a combination of particles, granules or any larger pieces of material generally uniform in composition which is loaded directly into the cargo spaces of a ship without any intermediate form of containment. .11 Terminal representative means a person appointed by the terminal or other facility where the ship is loading or unloading, who has responsibility for operations conducted by that terminal or facility with regard to the particular ship. .12 Trimming (loading cargo) is the partial or total levelling of the cargo within the holds, by means of loading spouts or chutes, portable machinery, equipment or manual labour . .13 Trimming (unloading cargo) is the shovelling or sweeping up of smaller quantities of the cargo in the holds by mechanical means (such as bulldozers) or other means to place them in a convenient position for discharge. .14 Trimming (ship) is the adding, removal or shifting of weight in a ship to achieve the required forward and aft draughts. ection 2 uitability of ships and terminals :.1 General .1.1 All ships nominated for loading should hold the appropriate valid statutory certification including, if required, the document of compliance* for ships carrying solid dangerous goods in bulk. It is recommended that the period of validity of the ship's certificates be sufficient to remain valid during loading, voyage and unloading times, plus a reserve to allow for delays in berthing, inclement weather or both. Applicable to ships constructed on or after 1 September 1984. 48 IMSBC CODE (Amendment 06-21) and supplement 2022 EDITION

Section 2 2.1.2 The shipowner, manager or operator, when offering a ship for a particular cargo or service, should ensure that the ship: .1 is maintained in a sound, seaworthy condition; .2 has on board a competent crew; .3 has on board at least one officer proficient in the languages used at both the loading and unloading ports, or has an officer available who is proficient in the English language; and .4 is free of defects that may prejudice the ship's safe navigation, loading or unloading. 2.1.3 It is essential that a ship selected to transport a solid bulk cargo be suitable for its intended purpose taking into account the terminals at which it will load or unload. 2.1.4 The charterer and shipper when accepting a ship for a particular cargo or service should ensure that the ship: .1 is suitable for access to the planned loading or unloading facilities; and .2 does not have cargo handling equipment which would inhibit the safety of the loading and unloading operations. 2.2 Ships 2.2.1 Ships nominated for bulk loading should be suitable for the intended cargo. Suitable ships should be: .1 weathertight, and efficient in all respects for the normal perils of the sea and the intended voyage; .2 provided with an approved stability and loading booklet written in a language understood by the ship's officers concerned and using standard expressions and abbreviations. If the language is neither English, nor French, nor Spanish, a translation into one of these languages should be included; .3 provided with hatch openings of sufficient size to enable the cargo to be loaded, stowed and unloaded satisfactorily; and .4 provided with the hatch identification numbers used in the loading manual and loading or unloading plan. The location, size and colour of these numbers should be chosen so that they are clearly visible to the operator of the loading or unloading equipment. 2.2.2 It is recommended that all ships which are required to carry out stress calculations should have on board an approved loading instrument for the rapid calculation of such stresses. 2.2.3 All propulsion and auxiliary machinery should be in good functional order. Deck equipment related to mooring and berthing operations, including anchors, cables, mooring lines, hawsers and winches, should be operable and in good order and condition. 2.2.4 All hatches, hatch operating systems and safety devices should be in good functional order, and used only for their intended purpose. 2.2.5 List indication lights, if fitted, should be tested prior to loading or unloading and proved operational. 2.2.6 Ship's own cargo handling equipment should be properly certificated and maintained, and used only under the general supervision of suitably qualified ship's personnel. 2.3 Terminals 2.3.1 Terminal operators should ensure that they only accept ships that can safely berth alongside their installation, taking into consideration issues such as: .1 water depth at the berth; .2 maximum size of the ship; IMSBC CODE (Amendment 06-21) and supplement 2022 EDITION 549

BLU Code .3 mooring arrangements; .4 fendering; .5 safe access; and .6 obstructions to loading/unloading operations. 2.3.2 Terminal equipment should be properly certificated and maintained in accordance with the relevant national regulations and/or standards, and only operated by duly qualified and, if appropriate, certificated personnel. 2.3.2.1 Where automatic weighing equipment is provided, this should be calibrated at regular intervals. 2.3.3 Terminal personnel should be trained in all aspects of safe loading and unloading of bulk carriers, commensurate with their responsibilities. 2.3.3.1 The training should be designed to provide familiarity with the general hazards of loading, unloading and carriage of bulk cargoes and the adverse effect improper cargo handling operations may have on the safety of the ship. 2.3.4 Terminal operators should ensure that personnel involved in the loading and unloading operations are duly rested to avoid fatigue. Section 3 Procedures between ship and shore prior to the ship's arrival 3.1 Information exchange: general 3.1.1 It is important that the ship be provided with information about a terminal so the loading or unloading can be planned. Similarly, the terminal will need information about the ship to enable preparations to be made to load or unload the ship. It is important that the information be exchanged in sufficient time to allow preparations to be made. 3.1.2 Before loading commences there should be an agreement between the master and the terminal representative as to the rate of loading and order in which the cargo is to be distributed so as to achieve the final loading plan. In general, this agreement should be based on one or more of the following options: .1 the limitations or restrictions on loading procedures, if such are specified in the ship's loading manual or trim and stability booklet, or both; .2 if the restrictions mentioned in .1 do not exist, and the ship has a loading instrument which has been approved, the loading plan should be prepared on the instrument and there should be a protocol in place so that the loading remains, at all times, within the approved stress limits of the ship; and/or .3 if neither .1 or .2 can be satisfied, then a conservative procedure should be followed. 3.1.3 Details should be provided of any necessary repairs which may delay berthing, the commencement of loading or unloading, or may delay the ship sailing on completion of loading or unloading. 3.1.4 The master should ensure he receives from the shipper of the intended cargo details of the nature of the cargo required by chapter VI of SOLAS 1974, as amended.* Where additional details, such as trimming or continuous measurement of the water in the cargo, etc., are required, the master should inform the terminal accordingly. * Refer to MSC/Circ.663 and to the form for cargo information, which is set out in appendix 5. 550 IMSBC CODE (Amendment 06-21) and supplement 2022 EDITION

Section 3 3.2 Information given by the ship to the terminal 3.2.1 In order to plan the proper disposition and availability of the cargo so as to meet the ship's loading plan, the loading terminal should be given the following information: .1 The ship's estimated time of arrival (ETA) off the port as early as possible. This advice should be updated as appropriate . . 2 At the time of initial ETA advice, the ship should also provide details of the following: .1 name, call sign, IMO Number of the ship, its flag State and port of registry; .2 a loading plan stating the quantity of cargo required, stowage by hatches, loading order and the quantity to be loaded in each pour, provided the ship has sufficient information to be able to prepare such a plan; .3 arrival and proposed departure draughts; .4 time required for deballasting; .5 the ship's length overall, beam, and length of the cargo area from the forward coaming of the forwardmost hatch to the after coaming of the aftmost hatch into which cargo is to be loaded or from which cargo is to be removed; .6 distance from the waterline to the first hatch to be loaded or unloaded and the distance from the ship's side to the hatch opening; .7 the location of the ship's accommodation ladder; .8 air draught; .9 details and capacities of ship's cargo handling gear; .10 number and type of mooring lines; and .11 any other item related to the ship requested by the terminal. .3 Similar information in respect of ETA, unloading plan and details of the ship are required by unloading terminals. 3.2.2 Ships arriving at loading or unloading terminals in a part-loaded condition should also advise: .1 berthing displacement and draughts; .2 previous loading or unloading port; .3 nature and stowage of cargo already on board and, when solid bulk cargoes are on board, the Bulk Cargo Shipping Name (BCSN), the IMSBC Code Class and UN Number, when applicable; .4 distribution of cargo on board, indicating that to be unloaded and that to remain on board. 3.2.3 Combination carriers (0B0 or 0/0) should advise of the following additional information: .1 nature of the preceding three cargoes; .2 date and place at which the last oil cargo was discharged; .3 advice as to content of slop tanks and whether fully inerted and sealed; and .4 date, place and name of authority that issued the last gas free certificate which includes pipelines and pumps.* 3.2.4 As soon as possible the ship should confirm that all holds into which cargo is to be loaded are clean, and free from previous cargo residues which in combination with the cargo to be loaded could create a hazard. 3.2.5 Information on the loading or unloading plan and on intended arrival and departure draughts should be progressively updated, and passed to the terminal as circumstances change. * Refer to the chapter for combination carriers in the International Safety Guide for Oil Tankers and Terminals (ISGOTT) and in particular to the section on cargo changeover checklists and the section on discharge of bulk cargoes.

LU Code .3 Information given by the terminal to the ship .3.1 On receipt of the ship's initial notification of its ETA, the terminal should give the ship the following information as soon as possible: .1 the name of the berth at which loading or unloading will take place and the estimated times for berthing and completion of loading or unloading; .2 characteristics of the loading or unloading equipment, including the terminal's nominal loading or unloading rate and the number of loading or unloading heads to be used; .3 features of the berth or jetty the master may need to be aware of, including the position of fixed and mobile obstructions, fenders, bollards and mooring arrangements; .4 minimum depth of water alongside the berth and in approach or departure channels; .5 water density at the berth; .6 the maximum distance between the waterline and the top of cargo hatch covers or coamings, whichever is relevant to the loading operation, and the maximum air draught; .7 arrangements for gangways and access; .8 which side of the ship is to be alongside the berth; .9 maximum allowable speed of approach to the jetty and availability of tugs, their type and bollard pull; .10 the loading sequence for different parcels of cargo, and any other restrictions if it is not possible to take the cargo in any order or any hold to suit the ship; .11 any properties of the cargo to be loaded which may present a hazard when placed in contact with cargo or residues on board; .12 advance information on the proposed cargo handling operations or changes to existing plans for cargo handling; .13 if the terminal's loading or unloading equipment is fixed, or has any limits to its movement; .14 mooring lines required; .15 warning of unusual mooring arrangements; .16 any restrictions on deballasting; .17 maximum sailing draught permitted by the port authority; and .18 any other items related to the terminal requested by the master. . 3.2 Information on estimated times for berthing and departure and on minimum water depth at the berth should be progressively updated and passed to the master on receipt of successive ETA advices. . 3.3 The terminal representative should be satisfied that the ship has been advised as early as possible of the information contained in the cargo declaration as required by chapter VI of SOLAS 1974, as amended. ection 4 >rocedures between the ship and the terminal prior to cargo handling -.1 Principles .1.1 The master is responsible at all times for the safe loading and unloading of the ship, the details of which should be confirmed to the terminal representative in the form of a loading or unloading plan. In addition, the master should: .1 ensure that the checklist in appendix 3 is completed in consultation with the terminal before loading or unloading is commenced; 52 IMSBC CODE (Amendment 06-21) and supplement 2022 EDITION

Section 4 .2 ensure that the loading or unloading of cargo and the discharge or intake of ballast water is under the control of the ship's officer in charge; .3 ensure that the disposition of cargo and ballast water is monitored throughout the loading or unloading process to ensure that the ship's structure is not overstressed; .4 ensure that the terminal representative is made aware of the requirements for harmonization between deballasting and cargo loading rates for his ship; .5 ensure that ballast water is discharged at rates which conform to the agreed loading plan and do not result in flooding of the quay or of adjacent craft; .6 retain on boi}rd sufficient officers and crew to attend to the adjustment of mooring lines or for any normal or emergency situation, having regard to the need of the crew to have sufficient rest periods to avoid fatigue; .7 ensure the loading or unloading plans have been passed to and agreed with the terminal representative; .8 ensure that the terminal representative is made aware of the cargo trimming requirements; .9 ensure that appropriate information about the cargo to be loaded (appendix 5) has been received to enable safe stowage and carriage to be achieved; .10 ensure that there is agreement between ship and shore as to the action to be taken in the event of rain, or other change in the weather, when the nature of the cargo would pose a hazard in the event of such a change; and .11 ensure that no hot work is carried out on board the ship while the ship is alongside the berth except with the permission of the terminal representative and in accordance with any requirements of the port administration. 4.1.2 The terminal representative is responsible for loading or unloading cargo in accordance with the hatch sequence and tonnages stated on the ship's loading or unloading plan. In addition, the terminal representative should: .1 complete the checklist in appendix 3 in consultation with the master before loading or unloading is commenced; .2 not deviate from the loading or unloading plan unless by prior consultation and agreement with the master; .3 trim the cargo, when loading or unloading, to the master's requirements; .4 maintain a record of the weight and disposition of the cargo loaded or unloaded and ensure that the weights in the hold do not deviate from the plan; .5 provide the master with the names and procedures for contacting the terminal personnel or shipper's agent who will have responsibility for the loading or unloading operation and with whom the master will have contact; .6 avoid damage to the ship by the loading or unloading equipment and inform the master, if damage occurs; .7 ensure that no hot work is carried out on board or in the vicinity of the ship while the ship is alongside the berth except with the permission of the master and in accordance with any requirements of the port administration; and .8 ensure that there is agreement between the master and the terminal representative at all stages and in relation to all aspects of the loading or unloading operation. 4.2 Procedures 4.2.1 The following are considered important procedures in respect of cargo loading: .1 the master and terminal representative should indicate agreement to the loading plan before commencement of loading by signing the plan in the spaces provided; IMSBC CODE (Amendment 06-21) and supplement 2022 EDITION 553

LU Code .2 the master should state, on the agreed loading plan, the order in which the holds are to be loaded, the weight of each pour, the total weight in each hold and the amount of cargo for vessel trimming purposes, if required; .3 the terminal representative, on receipt of the ship's initial loading plan (see 3.2.1), should advise the master of the nominal loading rate at which the ship may expect to receive the cargo and the estimated time required to complete each pour; .4 where it is not practical for the ship to completely discharge its ballast water prior to reaching the trimming stage in the loading process, the master and the terminal representative should agree on the times at wJ,ich loading may need to be suspended and the duration of such suspensions; .5 the loading plan should be prepared so as to ensure that all ballast pumping rates and loading rates are considered carefully to avoid overstressing the hull; .6 the quantities of cargo required to achieve the departure draft and trim should allow for all cargo on the terminal's conveyor systems to be run off and empty on completion of a loading. The terminal representative should advise the master of the nominal tonnage contained on its conveyor system and any requirements for clearing the conveyor system on completion of loading; and .7 communication arrangements between the ship and terminal should be capable of responding to requests for information on the loading process and of prompt compliance in the event that the master or terminal representative orders loading to be suspended. Consideration should be given to the disposition of cargo on the conveyor systems and to the response time in the event of an emergency stop . .2.2 The following are considered important procedures in respect of cargo unloading: ,.3.1 .. 3.2 ~.3.3 i54 .1 the terminal representative, when proposing or accepting the initial unloading plan, should advise the master of the nominal unloading rate and the estimated time required for each stage of the discharge; .2 the master should advise the hold order and the weight to be unloaded in each stage of the discharge; .3 the terminal representative should give the ship the maximum warning when it is intended to increase, or to reduce, the number of unloading heads used; and .4 communication arrangements between ship and terminal should be capable of responding to requests for information on the unloading process, and of prompt compliance in the event that the master orders unloading to be suspended. Implementation The loading or unloading plan should be prepared in a form such as that shown in appendix 2. Worked examples of this form are also shown in appendix 2. A different form may be used provided it contains the essential information to meet the requirements of this Code. The minimum information for this purpose is that enclosed in the heavy line box on the sample form. The loading or unloading plan should only be changed when a revised plan has been prepared, accepted and signed by both parties. Loading plans should be kept by the ship and terminal for a period of six months. A copy of the agreed loading or unloading plan and any subsequent amendments to it should be lodged with the appropriate authority of the port State. IMSBC CODE (Amendment 06-21) and supplement 2022 EDITION

Section 5 Section 5 Cargo loading and handling of ballast 5.1 General 5.1.1 When the cargo loading plan is agreed, the master and terminal representative should confirm the method of cargo operations so as to ensure no excessive stresses on the hull, tank top and associated structures, and exchange information to avoid any structural damage to the ship by cargo handling equipment. 5.1.2 The terminal representative should alert the master, when the cargo is heavy, or when the individual grab loads are large, that there may be high, localized impact loads on the ship's structure until the tank top is completely covered by cargo, especially when high free-fall drops are permitted. As such impacts have the potential for causing structural damage, special care should be taken at the start of the loading operation in each cargo hold. 5.1.3 Monitoring of the cargo handling operation, and effective communication between the terminal and ship, must be maintained at all times, and especially during final trimming of the ship. 5.1.4 Any requirement for cargo trimming should be in accordance with the procedures of the IMSBC Code, or the International Grain Code, as appropriate. 5.1.5 In order to effectively monitor the progress of the cargo loading operation it is essential for both the master and terminal representative to have readily accessible information on the total quantity loaded, as well as the quantities per pour. 5.1.6 On completion of loading, the master and the terminal representative should agree in writing that the ship has been loaded in accordance with the loading plan, including any agreed variations. 5.2 Ship duties 5.2.1 The master should advise the terminal representative of any deviation from the deballasting plan or any other matter which may affect cargo loading. 5.2.2 The ship should be kept upright or, if a list is required for operational reasons, it should be kept as small as possible. 5.2.3 The master should ensure close supervision of the loading operation and of the ship during final stages of loading. The master should advise the terminal representative when final trimming of the ship has to commence in order to allow for the conveyor system run-off. 5.3 Terminal duties 5.3.1 The terminal representative should advise the master on any change to the agreed loading rate and, at the completion of each pour, the terminal representative should advise the master of the weight loaded and that cargo loading continues in accordance with the agreed cargo plan. 5.3.2 The ship should be kept upright with the cargo distributed so as to eliminate any twisting of the ship's structure. 5.3.3 The terminal should use weight meters which are well maintained and provide an accuracy to within 1% of the rated quantity required over the normal range of loading rates. The terminal should frequently monitor the weight of cargo that is being loaded and inform the ship so that it can be compared with the cargo loading plan and the ship's calculation by draught marks.

f3LU Code Section 6 Unloading cargo and handling of ballast 6.1 General 5.1.1 When the cargo unloading plan is agreed, the master and terminal representative must confirm the method of cargo operations so as to ensure no excessive stresses on the hull, tank top and associated structures, including any measures to reduce and eliminate any structural damage to the ship by cargo handling equipment. 5.1.2 Monitoring and effective communication between the terminal and ship must be maintained at all times. 5.1.3 On completion of unloading, the master and the terminal representative should agree in writing that the ship has been unloaded in accordance with the agreed unloading plan, with the holds emptied and cleaned to the master's requirements, and should record any detected damage suffered by the ship. 5.1.4 In order to maintain an effective monitoring of the progress of the cargo unloading plan, it is essential for both the master and the terminal representative to have readily accessible information on the total unloaded quantity as well as on the quantities unloaded per hatch. 5.1.5 When ballasting one or more holds, master and terminal operator should take account of the possibility of the discharge of flammable vapours from the holds. Suitable precautions* should be taken before any hot work is permitted adjacent to or above that space. 6.2 Ship duties 5.2.1 The master will advise the terminal representative of any deviation from the ballasting plan or any other matter which may affect cargo unloading. 5.2.2 At the start and during all stages of unloading cargo, the master should ensure that frequent checks are made so that: .1 cargo spaces and other enclosed spaces are well ventilated, and persons are allowed to enter them only after they have been declared safe for entry in accordance with the guidelinest developed by the Organization; .2 the cargo is being unloaded from each hold in accordance with the agreed unloading plan; .3 the ballasting operation is proceeding in accordance with the agreed unloading plan; .4 the ship is securely moored, and that weather conditions are being monitored and local weather forecasts obtained; .5 the ship's draught is read regularly to monitor the progress of the unloading; .6 the terminal representative is warned immediately if the unloading process has caused damage, has created a hazardous situation, or is likely to do so; .7 the ship is kept upright, or, if a list is required for operational reasons, it is kept as small as possible; and .8 the unloading of the port side closely matches that of the starboard side in the same hold to avoid twisting the ship. 6.2.3 The master should ensure close supervision of the final stages of the unloading, to ensure that all cargo is unloaded. ‚Ä¢ Refer to the section on the operation of combination carriers in the International Safety Guide for Oil Tankers and Terminals (ISGOTT). t Refer to Revised recommendations for entering enclosed spaces aboard ships (resolution A.1050(27)). 556 IMSBC CODE (Amendment 06-21) and supplement 2022 EDITION

Section 6 6.3 Terminal duties 6.3.1 The terminal representative should follow the agreed unloading plan and should consult with the master if there is a need to amend the plan. 6.3.2 The ship is to be kept upright or, if a list is required for operational reasons, it is to be kept as small as possible. 6.3.3 The unloading of the port side should closely match that of the starboard side in the same hold, to avoid twisting the ship. 6.3.4 Unloading rates and sequences should not be altered by the terminal unless by prior consultation and agreement between the master and the terminal representative. 6.3.5 The terminal representative should advise the master when unloading is considered to be completed from each hold. 6.3.6 The terminal should make every effort to avoid damage to the ship when using unloading or hold cleaning equipment. If damage does occur, it should be reported to the master and, if necessary, repaired. If the damage could impair the structural capability or watertight integrity of the hull, or the ship's essential engineering systems, the Administration or an organization recognized by it and the appropriate authority of the port State should be informed, so that they can decide whether immediate repair is necessary or whether it can be deferred. In either case, the action taken, whether to carry out the repair or defer it, should be to the satisfaction of the Administration or an organization recognized by it and the appropriate authority of the port State. Where immediate repair is considered necessary, it should be carried out to the satisfaction of the master before the ship leaves the port. 6.3.7 The terminal representative should monitor the weather conditions and provide the master with the forecast of any local adverse weather condition.

Appendix 4 Guidelines for completing the ship/shore safety checklist Appendix 4 The purpose of the ship/shore safety checklist is to improve working relationships between ship and terminal, and thereby to improve the safety of operations. Misunderstandings occur and mistakes can be made when ships' officers do not understand the intentions of the terminal personnel, and the same applies when terminal personnel do not understand what the ship can and cannot safely do. Completing the checklist tQgether is intended to help ship and terminal personnel to recognize potential problems, and to be better prepared for them. 1 Is the depth of water at the berth, and the air draught,* adequate for the cargo operations to be completed? The depth of water should be determined over the entire area the ship will occupy, and the terminal should be aware of the ship's maximum air draught and water draught requirements during operations. Where the loaded draught means a small underkeel clearance at departure, the Master should consult and confirm that the proposed departure draught is safe and suitable. The ship should be provided with all available information about density and contaminates of the water at the berth. 2 Are mooring arrangements adequate for all local effects of tide, current, weather, traffic and craft alongside? Due regard should be given to the need for adequate fendering arrangements. Ships should remain well secured in their moorings. Alongside piers or quays, ranging of the ship should be prevented by keeping mooring lines taut; attention should be given to the movement of the ship caused by tides, currents or passing ships and by the operation in progress. Wire ropes and fibre ropes should not be used together in the same direction because of differences in their elastic properties. 3 In emergency, is the ship able to leave the berth at any time? The ship should normally be able to move under its own power at short notice, unless agreement to immobilize the ship has been reached with the terminal representative, and the port authority where applicable. In an emergency a ship may be prevented from leaving the berth at short notice by a number of factors. These include low tide, excessive trim or draught, lack of tugs, no navigation possible at night, main engine immobilized, etc. Both the ship and the terminal should be aware if any of these factors apply, so that extra precautions can be taken if need be. The method to be used for any emergency unberthing operation should be agreed, taking into account the possible risks involved. If emergency towing-off wires are required, agreement should be reached on their position and method of securing. 4 Is there safe access between the ship and the wharf? The means of access between the ship and the wharf must be safe and legal, and may be provided by either ship or terminal. It should consist of an appropriate gangway or accommodation ladder with a properly fastened safety net underneath it. Access equipment must be tended, since it can be damaged as a result of changing heights and draughts; persons responsible for tending it must be agreed between the ship and terminal, and recorded in the checklist. * The term air draught should be construed carefully: if the ship is in a river or an estuary, it usually refers to maximum mast height for passing under bridges, while on the berth it usually refers to the height available or required under the loader or unloader. IMSBC CODE (Amendment 06-21) and supplement 2022 EDITION 565

BLU Code The gangway should be positioned so that it is not underneath the path of cargo being loaded or unloaded. It should be well illuminated during darkness. A lifebuoy with a heaving line should be available on board the ship near the gangway or accommodation ladder. 5 Is the agreed ship/terminal communications system operative? Communication should be maintained in the most efficient way between the responsible officer on duty on the ship and the responsible person ashore. The selected system of communication and the language to be used, together with the necessary telephone numbers and/or radio channels, should be recorded in the checklist. 6 Are the liaison contact persons during operations positively identified? The controlling personnel on ship and terminal must maintain an effective communication with each other and their respective supervisors. Their names, and if appropriate where they can be contacted, should be recorded in the checklist. The aim should be to prevent development of hazardous situations, but if such a situation does arise, good communication and knowing who has proper authority can be instrumental in dealing with it. 7 Are adequate crew on board/ and adequate staff in the terminal/ for emergency? It is not possible or desirable to specify all conditions, but it is important that a sufficient number of personnel should be on board the ship, and in the terminal throughout the ship's stay, to deal with an emergency. The signals to be used in the event of an emergency arising ashore or on board should be clearly understood by all personnel involved in cargo operations. B Have any bunkering operations been advised and agreed? The person on board in charge of bunkering must be identified, together with the time, method of delivery :hose from shore, bunker barge, etc.) and the location of the bunker point on board. Loading of bunkers should be coordinated with the cargo operation. The terminal should confirm agreement to the procedure. Have any intended repairs to wharf or ship whilst alongside been advised and agreed? Hot work, involving welding, burning or use of naked flame, whether on the ship or the wharf may require a hot work permit. Work on deck which could interfere with cargo work will need to be coordinated. In the case of combination carriers a gas free certificate (including for pipelines and pumps) will be necessary, issued by a shore chemist approved by the terminal or port authority. 10 Has a procedure for reporting and recording damage from cargo operations been agreed? :::lperational damage can be expected in a harsh trade. To avoid conflict, a procedure must be agreed, before :argo operations commence, to record such damage. An accumulation of small items of damage to steel work :an cause significant loss of strength for the ship, so it is essential that damage is noted, to allow prompt repair. 11 Has the ship been provided with copies of port and terminal regulations, including safety and pollution requirements and details of emergency services? <\lthough much information will normally be provided by a ship's agent, a fact sheet containing this information ,hould be passed to the ship on arrival, and should include any local regulations controlling the discharge of )allast water and hold washings. IMSBC CODE (Amendment 06-21) and supplement 2022 EDITION

Appendix 4 12 Has the shipper provided the master with the properties of the cargo in accordance with the requirements of chapter VI of SOLAS? The shipper should pass to the master, for example, the grade of cargo, particle size, quantity to be loaded, stowage factor, and cargo moisture content. The IMSBC Code gives guidance on this. The ship should be advised of any material which may contaminate or react with the planned cargo, and the ship should ensure that the holds are free of such material. 13 /s the atmosphere safe in holds and enclosed spaces to which access may be required, have fljmigated cargoes been identified, and has the need for monitoring of atmosphere been agreed by ship and terminal? Rusting of steelwork or the characteristics of a cargo may cause a hazardous atmosphere to develop. Consideration should be given to: oxygen depletion in holds; the effect of fumigation either of cargo to be discharged, or of cargo in a silo before loading from where gas can be swept on board along with the cargo with no warning to the ship; and leakage of gases, whether poisonous or explosive, from adjacent holds or other spaces. 14 Have the cargo handling capacity and any limits of travel for each loader/unloader been passed to the ship/terminal? The number of loaders or unloaders to be used should be agreed, and their capabilities understood by both parties. The agreed maximum transfer rate for each loader/unloader should be recorded in the checklist. Limits of travel of loading or unloading equipment should be indicated. This is essential information when planning cargo operations in berths where a ship must be shifted from one position to another due to loading. Gear should always be checked for faults and that it is clear of contaminates from previous cargoes. The accuracy of weighing devices should be ascertained frequently. 15 Has a cargo loading and unloading plan been calculated for all stages of loading! deballasting or unloading/ballasting? Where possible the ship should prepare the plan before arrival. To permit her to do so the terminal should provide whatever information the ship requests for planning purposes. On ships which require longitudinal strength calculations, the plan should take account of any permissible maxima for bending moments and shear forces. The plan should be agreed with the terminal and a copy passed over for use by terminal staff. All watch officers on board and terminal supervisors should have access to a copy. No deviation from the plan should be allowed without agreement of the master. According to SOLAS regulation Vl/7, it is required to lodge a copy of the plan with the appropriate authority of the port State. The person receiving the plan should be recorded in the checklist. 16 Have the holds to be worked been clearly identified in the loading or unloading plan, showing the sequence of work, and the grade and tonnage of cargo to be transferred each time the hold is worked? The necessary information should be provided in the form as set out in appendix 2 of this Code. 17 Has the need for trimming of cargo in the holds been discussed, and have the method and extent been agreed? A well-known method is spout trimming, and this can usually achieve a satisfactory result. Other methods use bulldozers, front-end loaders, deflector blades, trimming machines or even manual trimming. The extent of trimming will depend upon the nature of the cargo, and must be in accordance with the IMSBC Code, or the International Grain Code, as appropriate. IMSBC CODE (Amendment 06-21) and supplement 2022 EDITION 567

BLU Code 18 Do both ship and terminal understand and accept that if the ballast programme becomes out of step with the cargo operations, it will be necessary to suspend cargo operations until the ballast operation has caught up? All parties will prefer to load or discharge the cargo without stops if possible. However, if the cargo or ballast programmes are out of step a stop to cargo handling must be ordered by the master and accepted by the terminal to avoid the possibility of inadvertently overstressing the ship's structure. A cargo operations plan will often indicate cargo check points, when conditions will also allow confirmation that the cargo and ballast handling operations are in alignment. If the maximum rate at which the ship can safely accept the cargo is less than the cargo handling capacity of the terminal, it may be necessary to negotiate pauses in the cargo transfer programme or for the terminal to operate equipment at less than the maximum capacity. In areas where extremely cold weather is likely, the potential for frozen ballast or ballast lines should be recognized. 19 Have the intended procedures for removing cargo residues lodged in the holds while unloading been explained to the ship and accepted? The use of bulldozers, front-end loaders or pneumatic/hydraulic hammers to shake material loose should be undertaken with care, as wrong procedures can damage or distort ships' steelwork. Prior agreement to the need and method intended, together with adequate supervision of operators, will avoid subsequent claims or weakening of the ship's structure. 20 Have the procedures to adjust the final trim of the loading ship been decided and agreed? Any tonnages proposed at the commencement of loading for adjusting the trim of the ship can only be provisional, and too much importance should not be attached to them. The significance lies in ensuring that the requirement is not overlooked or ignored. The actual quantities and positions to be used to achieve final ship's trim will depend upon the draft readings taken immediately beforehand. The ship should be informed of the tonnage on the conveyor system since that quantity may be large and must still be loaded when the order "stop loading" is given. This figure should be recorded in the checklist. 21 Has the terminal been advised of the time required for the ship to prepare for sea, on completion of cargo work? The procedure of securing for sea remains as important as it ever was, and should not be skimped. Hatches ;hould be progressively secured on completion so that only one or two remain to be closed after cargo work is finished. \t1odern deep-water terminals for large ships may have very short passages before the open sea is encountered. The time needed to secure, therefore, may vary between day or night, summer or winter, fine weather or foul Neather. :arly advice must be given to the terminal if any extension of time is necessary. ,68 IMSBC CODE (Amendment 06-21) and supplement 2022 EDITION

Foreword 1 In response to the continuing loss of ships carrying solid bulk cargoes - sometimes without trace and with heavy loss of life - the Code of Safe Practice for the Safe Loading and Unloading of Bulk Carriers (BLU Code) was developed by IMO as one of a number of measures to enhance the operational and sfructural safety of bulk carriers. It was adopted as a recommendatory instrument by the International Maritime Organization's Assembly at its twentieth session in November 1997 by resolution A.862(20) and amended by resolutions MSC.238(82) and MSC.304(87). 2 Possible stress and damage imposed by cargo handling throughout the life of a ship was considered to be a possible contributory cause of structural failure of bulk carriers leading to casualties and losses. The purpose of the BLU Code, therefore, is to provide guidance to ship masters of bulk carriers, terminal operators and other parties for the safe handling, loading and unloading of solid bulk cargoes. 3 To augment the BLU Code, the Manual on loading and unloading of solid bulk cargoes for terminal representatives (BLU Manual) is intended to provide more detailed guidance to terminal representatives (as defined in the BLU Code) and others involved in the handling of solid bulk cargoes; including those responsible for the training of personnel. 4 It should be noted that in this Manual, a reference to an appendix is a reference to an appendix in the BLU Code and a reference to an annex is to an annex in this Manual. 5 Further guidance on the safe loading and unloading of solid bulk cargoes is contained in the following publications: Bulk Carriers, Handle with Care, IACS Ltd. 1998, 36 Broadway, London SW1 H 0BH, United Kingdom Tel: +44 (0)20 7976 0660, Fax: +44 (0)20 7808 1100 Email: permsec@iacs.org.uk Website: http://www.iacs.org.uk The Loading and Unloading of Solid Bulk Cargoes, ICHCA International Ltd., Suite 2, 85 Western Road, Romford, Essex, RM1 3LS, United Kingdom Tel: +44 (0)1708 735 295, Fax: +44 (0)1708 735 225 Email: info@ichcainternational.co.uk IMSBC CODE (Amendment 06-21) and supplement 2022 EDITION 575



MSC/Circ.1160 Manual on loading and unloading of solid bulk cargoes for terminal representatives 1 The Maritime Safety Committee (MSC), at its seventy-sixth session, in considering the Report of the Working Group on Bulk Carrier Safety concerning the issue of the risk control options for the improvement of the ship/terminal interface for bulk carriers noted the need to harmonize training programmes for terminal personnel world-wide. 2 The Maritime Safety Committee, at its seventy-sixth session, further noted that the above concern could be addressed by the application of the Code of Practice for the Safe Loading and Unloading of Bulk Carriers (BLU Code) and that the risk control options in the Manual on loading and unloading of solid bulk cargoes for terminal representatives under development would address the concerns referred to above. 3 The Maritime Safety Committee, at its seventy-eighth session (12 to 21 May 2004), agreed that the application of the BLU Code would address the concerns on risk control options above and urged Member Governments, shipowners, ship operators and terminals to apply the guidance contained therein. 4 The Maritime Safety Committee, at its seventy-eighth session (12 to 21 May 2004), agreed to continue the development of the Manual on loading and unloading of solid bulk cargoes for terminal representatives, taking into account the guidance in the IBTA guidelines for terminal representatives at ship/shore interface, when finalizing the Manual. 5 The Maritime Safety Committee, at its eightieth session (11 to 20 May 2005), approved the Manual on loading and unloading of solid bulk cargoes for terminal representatives and agreed that the application of the guidance contained therein would address the concerns on risk control options and urged Member Governments, shipowners, ship operators and terminals to apply the guidance contained therein. 6 Member Governments are invited to implement the BLU Code and to bring the annexed Manual on loading and unloading of solid bulk cargoes for terminal representatives, to the attention of terminals, shipowners, ship operators, shipmasters, shippers, receivers and other parties concerned. IMSBC CODE (Amendment 06-21) and supplement 2022 EDITION 577



Manual on loading and unloading of solid bulk cargoes for terminal representatives Introduction 1 The BLU Code applies to the loading and unloading of solid bulk cargoes, to or from bulk carriers of more than 500 gross tonnage. The BLU Code does not apply to ships which are not bulk carriers, by definition, and ships which are being loaded or unloaded using shipboard equipment only. 2 The guidance in this Manual is intended to complement the BLU Code by providing guidance on good practice, regardless of ship size, terminal capacity or cargo quantity. This should assist terminal representatives to implement the Code. 3 Although this Manual is written primarily in the context of the operation of major bulk terminals operating ship loaders and unloaders, smaller bulk facilities and non-specialist terminals may also load and/or unload solid bulk cargoes by grabs, conveyors, chutes or even directly from vehicles etc. Not all the guidance in the Manual may be appropriate to such smaller terminals and facilities and the ships they serve but the general principles should still apply and be followed. 4 The guidance in this Manual is intended primarily to assist terminal representatives to understand the key issues to be dealt with at the interface between the ship and the terminal. It should also assist relevant ships' personnel to understand the issues involved from the terminal's perspective. 5 It should be noted that in this Manual, a reference to an appendix is a reference to an appendix in the BLU Code and a reference to an annex is to an annex in this Manual. 6 In the event of a conflict between the Code of Safe Practice for Solid Bulk Cargoes (BC Code) and the International Code for the Safe Carriage of Crain in Bulk (International Grain Code), the provisions of the International Grain Code should prevail. layout of guidelines The text with the grey bar contains the specific language of the BLU Code and that without the grey bar contains the guidelines for the terminal representative. Definitions Definitions contained in the BLU Code are on page 581. In addition, the following definitions refer to a number of other expressions used in these guidelines. BLU Code means the Code of Practice for the Safe Loading and Unloading of Bulk Carriers, as contained in the annex to IMO Assembly resolution A.862(20) of 27 November 1997. Bulk carrier means a ship which is constructed generally with single deck, top-side tanks and hopper side tanks in cargo spaces, and is intended primarily to carry dry cargo in bulk, and includes such types as ore carriers and combination carriers.* * Refer to Interpretation of provisions of SOLAS chapter XII on additional safety measures for bulk carriers (resolution MSC.79(70)). IMSBC CODE (Amendment 06-21) and supplement 2022 EDITION 579

nu Manual :argo air draught means the distance from the surface of the water to the lowest point of the loader or mloader when in a fully raised position. rerminal means any fixed, floating or mobile facility equipped and used for the loading and/or unloading of >ulk cargo. The term includes that part of a dock, pier, berth, jetty, quay, wharf or similar structure at which t ship may tie up. :hipper/receiver means any person in whose name or on whose behalf a contract of carriage of goods by sea 1as been concluded, or on whose behalf the goods are delivered to or received from the ship in relation to he contract of carriage by sea. :towage factor is the number of cubic metres which one tonne of the material will occupy. :i80 IMSBC CODE (Amendment 06-21) and supplement 2022 EDITION

Section 1 Definitions BLU Code Section 1 1.1 Air draught means the vertical distance from the surface of the water to the highest point of mast or aerial. 1.2 Bulk Cargo Shipping Name (BCSN) identifies a bulk cargo during transport by sea. When a cargo is listed in the IMSBC Code, the Bulk Cargo Shipping Name of the cargo is identified by capital letters in the individual schedules or in the index. When the cargo is a dangerous good, as defined in the International Maritime Dangerous Goods (IMDG) Code, as defined in regulation Vll/1.1 of the SOLAS Convention, the Proper Shipping Name of that cargo is the Bulk Cargo Shipping Name. 1.3 Combination carriers (080 or 0/0) means a ship whose design is similar to a conventional bulk carrier but is equipped with pipelines, pumps and inert gas plant so as to enable the carriage of oil cargoes in designated spaces. 1.4 Conveyor system means the entire system for delivering cargo from the shore stockpile or receiving point to the ship. 1.5 Hot work means the use of open fires and flames, power tools or hot rivets, grinding, soldering, burning, cutting, welding or any other repair work involving heat or creating sparks which may lead to a hazard because of the presence or proximity of flammable atmosphere. 1.6 IMSBC Code means the International Maritime Solid Bulk Cargoes Code as defined in regulation Vl/1.1 of the SOLAS Convention. 1.7 List indication lights means lights, visible from the deck, which light up to show that a ship is listing. 1.8 Master means the master of the ship or a ship's officer designated by the master. 1.8 Standard shipping industry practice is that the Chief Officer (First Mate) is the designated officer in charge of cargo operations, and is the person with whom the terminal representative will normally liaise. 1.9 Pour means the quantity of cargo poured through one hatch opening as one step in the loading plan, i.e. from the time the spout is positioned over a hatch opening until it is moved to another hatch opening. 1.10 Solid bulk cargo means any cargo, other than a liquid or a gas, consisting of a combination of particles, granules or any larger pieces of material generally uniform in composition which is loaded directly into the cargo spaces of a ship without any intermediate form of containment. 1.11 Terminal representative means a person appointed by the terminal or other facility where the ship is loading or unloading, who has responsibility for operations conducted by that terminal or facility with regard to the particular ship. 1.11 For reasons of practicality it is accepted that the role of terminal representative cannot be limited to one person throughout the entire loading or unloading period, and that provision must be made for shift patterns and compliance with hours of work agreements and regulations. 1.12 Trimming (loading cargo) is the partial or total levelling of the cargo within the holds, by means of loading spouts or chutes, portable machinery, equipment or manual labour. 1.13 Trimming (unloading cargo) is the shovelling or sweeping up of smaller quantities of the cargo in the holds by mechanical means (such as bulldozers) or other means to place them in a convenient position for discharge. 1.14 Trimming (ship) is the adding, removal or shifting of weight in a ship to achieve the required forward and aft draughts.

.U Manual ~ction 2 1itability of ships and terminals 2.1 General 2.1.1 All ships nominated for loading should hold the appropriate valid statutory certification including, if required, the document of compliance* for ships carrying solid dangerous goods in bulk. It is recommended that the period of validity of the ship's certificates be sufficient to remain valid during loading, voyage and unloading times, plus a reserve to allow for delays in berthing, inclement weather or both. 2.1.2 The shipowner, manager or operator, when offering a ship for a particular cargo or service, should ensure that the ship: .1 is maintained in a sound, seaworthy condition; .2 has on board a competent crew; .3 has on board at least one officer proficient in the languages used at both the loading and unloading ports, or has an officer available who is proficient in the English language; and .4 is free of defects that may prejudice the ship's safe navigation, loading or unloading . .1.2 Terminals should determine the suitability of a ship for compatibility with both loading and/or ,loading terminal infrastructure as appropriate. 2.1.3 It is essential that a ship selected to transport a solid bulk cargo be suitable for its intended purpose taking into account the terminals at which it will load or unload . .1.3 It is important that the terminal operator keeps its relevant customers informed of current terminal andards, limitations and operating conditions in terms of any changes to relevant navigational conditions, ¬∑ater depths, loading/unloading equipment and rates. 2.1.4 The charterer and shipper when accepting a ship for a particular cargo or service should ensure that the ship: .1 is suitable for access to the planned loading or unloading facilities; and .2 does not have cargo handling equipment which would inhibit the safety of the loading and unloading operations . .1.4 In addition to the checks carried out by the charterer and/or shipper and/or receiver, the terminal perator should take reasonable steps to ensure that all bulk carriers nominated for loading/unloading at the ~rminal are operationally suitable in all respects for the purpose. he following checks are examples of the type of checks that may be carried out: .1 Check appropriate sources of information to confirm that ship meets berth maximum and minimum size limits. - Length overall/beam/draught. - Number of holds. - Hatch lengths and widths. Compare dimensions with the most suitable hatch openings on the basis of the terminal's own experience. If hatches are less than the preferred size, loader/unloader operators should be informed and appropriate precautions taken. - Gearless/geared/geartype. Location of gear.

Z.3.1.2 Pre-arrival ship/shore exchange of information should clarify: .1 Whether ship or terminal will provide the gangway. Responsibility for providing safety net, lighting and care of gangway. Generally the master is responsible for ensuring that there is safe access to and from the ship. Normally the ship provides the gangway and master and terminal representative jointly confirm that it is safe and suitable. Where the ship's own gangway is not suitable the terminal may provide one. However, the master is still obliged to ensure that it is maintained in a safe condition at all times . . 2 If ship is geared, the ship's/charterer should provide a plan of the ship giving the positions of the derricks or cranes, and the distances between them. The terminal representative should check the validity of test reports and certificates for cranes. . 3 Loader/unloader booms should be raised clear of berth in good time when a ship is berthing/ unberthing . .4 Loaders/unloaders should be parked clear of the normal angle of approach of a berthing ship, in case the bow overshoots the jetty. 2.3.2 Terminal equipment should be properly certificated and maintained in accordance with the relevant national regulations and/or standards, and only operated by duly qualified and, if appropriate, certificated personnel. 2.3.2 "Maintenance" refers not just to running repairs and upkeep of equipment, but to the planned and systematic inspection and maintenance of equipment at periodic intervals. This is normally carried out in accordance with manufacturer's recommendations, national requirements, and industry codes of practice. 2.3.2.1 Where automatic weighing equipment is provided, this should be calibrated at regular intervals. 2.3.2.1 "Examination and testing" means the thorough examination of the crane or equipment at regular intervals, in accordance with relevant legislation and insurance requirements. Items needing particular attention include: .1 Lifting equipment. .2 Rotating equipment. .3 Access equipment. .4 Safety devices - alarms, anemometers, limit switches and controls, emergency stops, emergency escape and fire control equipment. 584 IMSBC CODE (Amendment 06-21) and supplement 2022 EDITION

nu Manual ,ection 3 Jrocedures between ship and shore prior to ship's arrival 3.1 Information exchange: general 3.1.1 It is important that the ship be provided with information about a terminal so the loading or unloading can be planned. Similarly, the terminal will need information about the ship to enable preparations to be made to load or unload the ship. It is important that the information be exchanged in sufficient time to allow preparations to be made. U .1 (See annex 1.) 3.1.2 Before loading commences there should be an agreement between the master and the terminal representative as to the rate of loading and order in which the cargo is to be distributed so as to achieve the final loading plan. In general, this agreement should be based on one or more of the following options: .1 the limitations or restrictions on loading procedures, if such are specified in the ship's loading manual or trim and stability booklet, or both; .2 if the restrictions mentioned in .1 do not exist, and the ship has a loading instrument which has been approved, the loading plan should be prepared on the instrument and there should be a protocol in place so that the loading remains, at all times, within the approved stress limits of the ship; and/or .3 if neither .1 or .2 can be satisfied, then a conservative procedure should be followed. 1.1.2 The master should forward the proposed loading/unloading plan to the terminal before the ship trrives: .1 The terminal representative should check the plan and ensure it corresponds to its expectations. If it does not, the terminal may revert to the ship requesting a review of the proposed plan . . 2 By giving the ship adequate time to prepare an alternative plan, in compliance with the ship's stability booklet and loading manual or instrument, it should be possible to identify a mutually acceptable loading sequence . . 3 However, even where the load plan is not the terminal's preferred option, the terminal representative should coordinate and agree to a plan before starting operations. Operations should not start until agreement has been obtained. 3.1.3 Details should be provided of any necessary repairs which may delay berthing, the commencement of loading or unloading, or may delay the ship sailing on completion of loading or unloading. t1.3 The terminal should be informed if any proposed visits by ship repair contractors or service )ersonnel, or if cranes or other equipment are required on the jetty. 3.1.4 The master should ensure he receives from the shipper of the intended cargo, details of the nature of the cargo required by chapter VI of SOLAS 1974, as amended.* Where additional details, such as trimming or continuous measurement of the water in the cargo, etc., are required, the master should inform the terminal accordingly. J.1.4 Before commencement of loading of a solid bulk cargo, the shipper must provide the master with he characteristics and properties of the cargo, including: .1 Stowage factor, angle of repose, trimming procedures, and likelihood of shifting. Refer to MSC/Circ.663 and to the form for cargo information, which is set out in appendix 5 to the BLU Code. :i86 IMSBC CODE (Amendment 06-21) and supplement 2022 EDITION

Section 3 .2 The transportable moisture limit and average moisture content in the case of a concentrate or other cargo which may liquefy . . 3 Flammability, toxicity, corrosiveness, chemical, oxygen depletion and any other hazards of the cargo, as applicable. 3.1.5 The terminal representative should verify that the master has received the relevant cargo declaration form information, as applicable, in good time. (See BLU Code - appendix 5.) 3.1.6 The master should_ inform the terminal representative of any particular precautions to be taken with the loading or unloading of the cargo. 3.2 Information given by the ship to the terminal 3.2.1 In order to plan the proper disposition and availability of the cargo so as to meet the ship's loading plan, the loading terminal should be given the following information: .1 The ship's estimated time of arrival (ETA) off the port as early as possible. This advice should be updated as appropriate . . 2 At the time of initial ETA advice, the ship should also provide details of the following: .2.1 name, call sign, IMO Number of the ship, its flag State and port of registry; .2.2 a loading plan stating the quantity of cargo required, stowage by hatches, loading order and the quantity to be loaded in each pour, provided the ship has sufficient information to be able to prepare such a plan; .2.3 arrival and departure draughts; .2.4 time required for deballasting; .2.5 the ship's length overall, beam, and length of the cargo area from the forward coaming of the forwardmost hatch to the after coaming of the aftmost hatch into which cargo is to be loaded or from which cargo is to be removed; .2.6 distance from the waterline to the first hatch to be loaded or unloaded and the distance from the ship's side to the hatch opening; .2.7 the location of the ship's accommodation ladder; .2.8 air draught; .2.9 details and capacities of ship's cargo handling gear; .2.10 number and type of mooring lines; and .2.11 any other item related to the ship requested by the terminal. .3 Similar information in respect of ETA, unloading plan and details of the ship are required by unloading terminals. 3.2.1 See example of pre-arrival exchange of information checklist (annex 1) . .1 It is important that the terminal receives updated ETAs . . 2 Notifying the terminal of the proposed loading or unloading plan well in advance of arrival gives the terminal the opportunity to check that the information on which it is based is correct. For example, a plan may be based on a terminal having two loaders/unloaders where there is actually only one available. It also allows the terminal to check the plan against its preferred rotation, and to request a modification . . 3 The master then has the opportunity to recalculate the plan and clarify any questions so that a safe, correct and mutually acceptable plan is agreed preferably before the ship berths. IMSBC CODE (Amendment 06-21) and supplement 2022 EDITION 587

'.U Manual .4 If the terminal's suggested plan is unsuitable for the ship, and does not meet its stability and hull stress criteria, then the terminal representative and master should coordinate and agree on a plan before operations begin . . 5 Other items of information requested by the terminal may include: .1 Confirmation that ballast water is clean seawater ballast. . 2 Any ship defects which could affect operations . .3 Ship's operational and navigational equipment safety status . .4 Details of any planned bunkering and storing operations, or repairs to be carried out. .5 Ballast handling rates . .6 Terminals should require both a cargo stowage plan and a plan indicating the order of loading/ unloading and the quantity to be loaded/unloaded into/from each hold. 3.2.2 Ships arriving at loading or unloading terminals in a part loaded condition should also advise: .1 berthing displacement and draughts; .2 previous loading or unloading port; .3 nature and stowage of cargo already on board and, when solid bulk cargoes are on board, the Bulk Cargo Shipping Name (BCSN), the IMSBC Code Class and UN Number, when applicable; .4 distribution of cargo on board, indicating that to be unloaded and that to remain on board. !.2 Ships should provide the terminal with a loading or unloading plan stating the cargo distribution m for the cargo to be loaded/unloaded, the hold rotation and quantities to be loaded/unloaded per run. 3.2.3 Combination carriers (080 or 0/0) should advise of the following additional information: .1 nature of the preceding three cargoes; .2 date and place at which the last oil cargo was discharged; .3 advice as to content of slop tanks and whether fully inerted and sealed; and .4 date, place and name of authority that issued the last gas-free certificate which includes pipelines and pumps.* !.3 During the unloading of dry bulk cargo it may be necessary to ballast one or more holds to reduce i cargo air draught of the ship. This is unlikely to introduce hazards if the pipeline system has been well shed. However, if a pump or pipeline has not been adequately washed, the ballasting operation may charge residual oil into the hold. Atmospheric tests in the hold should therefore be made before any hot irk is carried out in, adjacent to, or above a ballasted hold. 3.2.4 As soon as possible the ship should confirm that all holds into which cargo is to be loaded are clean, and free from previous cargo residues which in combination with the cargo to be loaded could create a hazard. 3.2.5 Information on the loading or unloading plan and on intended arrival and departure draughts should be progressively updated, and passed to the terminal as circumstances change. ~fer to the chapter for combination carriers in the International Safety Guide for Oil Tankers and Terminals (ISGOTT) and in ticular to the section on cargo changeover checklists and the section on discharge of bulk cargoes. IMSBC CODE (Amendment 06-21) and supplement 2022 EDITION

Section 3 3.3 Information given by the terminal to the ship 3.3.1 On receipt of the ship's initial notification of its ETA, the terminal should give the ship the following information as soon as possible: .1 the name of the berth at which loading or unloading will take place and the estimated times for berthing and completion of loading or unloading; .2 characteristics of the loading or unloading equipment, including the terminal's nominal loading or unloading rate and the number of loading or unloading heads to be used; .3 features of the berth or jetty the master may need to be aware of, including the position of fixed and mobile obstructions, fenders, bollards and mooring arrangements; .4 minimum depth of water alongside the berth and in approach or departure channels; .5 water density at the berth; .6 the maximum distance between the waterline and the top of cargo hatch covers or coamings, whichever is relevant to the loading operation, and the maximum air draught; . 7 arrangements for gangways and access; .8 which side of the ship is to be alongside the berth; .9 maximum allowable speed of approach to the jetty and availability of tugs, their type and bollard pull; .10 the loading sequence for different parcels of cargo, and any other restrictions if it is not possible to take the cargo in any order or any hold to suit the ship; .11 any properties of the cargo to be loaded which may present a hazard when placed in contact with cargo or residues on board; .12 advance information on the proposed cargo handling operations or changes to existing plans for cargo handling; .13 if the terminal's loading or unloading equipment is fixed, or has any limits to its movement; .14 mooring lines required; .15 warning of unusual mooring arrangements; .16 any restrictions on deballasting; .17 maximum sailing draught permitted by the port authority; and .18 any other items related to the terminal requested by the master. 3.3.1 The terminal should furnish as applicable: (See example of pre-arrival ship/shore exchange of information (annex 1).) .1 The expected maximum and average loading/unloading rates may be discussed and clarified during completion of the ship/shore checklist at the arrival meeting between the terminal representative and the master. . 2 Information regarding draught survey requirements where applicable . . 3 Information regarding any draught surveys to be carried out, usually requesting ballast tanks to be either full or empty, containing clean seawater ballast where possible. .4 Usual anchorage and pilot embarkation area . . 5 Whether ships may berth/depart at any time, or if it is necessary to wait for certain tidal conditions.

In addition, the master should: .1 ensure that the checklist in appendix 3 is completed in consultation with the terminal before loading or unloading is commenced; .2 ensure that the loading or unloading of cargo and the discharge or intake of ballast water is under the control of the ship's officer in charge; .3 ensure that the disposition of cargo and ballast water is monitored throughout the loading or unloading process to ensure that the ship's structure is not overstressed; .4 ensure that the terminal representative is made aware of the requirements for harmonization between deballasting and cargo loading rates for his ship; .5 ensure that ballast water is discharged at rates which conform to the agreed loading plan and do not result in flooding of the quay or of adjacent craft; .6 retain on board sufficient officers and crew to attend to the adjustment of mooring lines or for any normal or emergency situation, having regard to the need of the crew to have sufficient rest periods to avoid fatigue; .7 ensure the loading or unloading plans have been passed to and agreed with the terminal representative; .8 ensure that the terminal representative is made aware of the cargo trimming requirements; .9 ensure that appropriate information about the cargo to be loaded (appendix 5) has been received to enable safe stowage and carriage to be achieved; .10 ensure that there is agreement between ship and shore as to the action to be taken in the event of rain, or other change in the weather, when the nature of the cargo would pose a hazard in the event of such a change; and .11 ensure that no hot work is carried out on board the ship while the ship is alongside the berth except with the permission of the terminal representative and in accordance with any requirements of the port administration. ~O IMSBC CODE (Amendment 06-21) and supplement 2022 EDITION

Section 4 4.1.1 The loading/unloading plan should preferably be agreed in principle prior to the arrival of the ship. .1 The terminal representative should ensure the loader/unloader operators and/or terminal control room personnel receive a copy of the agreed load/unload plan. They should also be immediately notified of any subsequently agreed changes. Copies should be retained in the terminal's file for that ship. . 2 The total quantity to be kept for trimming should be clearly stated in the loading plan . .3 The quantity remaining on the belt should be accurately known, or else the belts should run off before tr~mming commences . .4 Where loading terminals insert empty gaps into the flow of material to allow for changing hatches, these gaps should be adequate and there should be good communications between loader and stockyard to ensure the loader can move safely. . 5 For multi-unloader or loader operations the terminal should inform the master of its procedures for preventing collisions between the loaders/unloaders. The cargo plans should normally ensure that the machines will be separated by at least one unworked hatch. .6 The actual quantities to be trimmed should be determined by the master in good time as loading completes, and the distribution clearly specified to the terminal representative and to the loader operator. .7 Due allowance should be made for the belt run-off on completion . .8 Where load/unload plans are programmed into the computerized control system of loader/ unloaders, the operator should monitor these carefully, keep the programme updated as the operation progresses, double check if doubt, and be able to revert to a manual tally in event of any problems with the computer programme . .9 The terminal representative should notify the master when cargo conditions have changed due to weather. 4.1.2 The terminal representative is responsible for loading or unloading cargo in accordance with the hatch sequence and tonnages stated on the ship's loading or unloading plan. In addition, the terminal representative should: .1 complete the checklist in appendix 3 in consultation with the master before loading or unloading is commenced; .2 not deviate from the loading or unloading plan unless by prior consultation and agreement with the master; .3 trim the cargo, when loading or unloading, to the master's requirements; .4 maintain a record of the weight and disposition of the cargo loaded or unloaded and ensure that the weights in the hold do not deviate from the plan; .5 provide the master with the names and procedures for contacting the terminal personnel or shipper's agent who will have responsibility for the loading or unloading operation and with whom the master will have contact; .6 avoid damage to the ship by the loading or unloading equipment and inform the master, if damage occurs; .7 ensure that no hot work is carried out on board or in the vicinity of the ship while the ship is alongside the berth except with the permission of the master and in accordance with any requirements of the port administration; and .8 ensure that there is agreement between the master and the terminal representative at all stages and in relation to all aspects of the loading or unloading operation. IMSBC CODE (Amendment 06-21) and supplement 2022 EDITION 591

LU Manual .1.2 The terminal representative responsible for loading or unloading cargo should: .1 Inform the ship of all relevant information regarding: .1 Cargo operations . . 2 Ship and terminal safety issues and regulations. . 3 Arrangements for safe access to/from the ship. .4 Arrangements for access for crew members through the terminal premises. . 5 Weather and tidal conditions . . 6 Mooring ~anagement recommendations . . 2 Understand and respond to the information provided by the master regarding particular safety and operational issues of concern to the ship. . 3 Have sufficient personnel available to deal with any emergencies likely to affect the safety of its personnel and facilities . .4 Have details to be specified in the ship/shore checklist, and should also be provided with the terminal's regulations and information booklet. .5 Have a procedure for checking the origin, nature and extent of damage whether notified by terminal or ship personnel. .6 Have knowledge of hot work procedures to identify any risks, and be familiar with the control measures and precautions required, noting that it may be necessary to ballast one or more holds to reduce the cargo air draught of the ship. With combination carriers, this is unlikely to introduce hazards if the pipeline system has been well washed. However, if a pump or pipeline has not been adequately washed, the ballasting operation may discharge residual oil into the hold. Atmospheric tests in the hold should therefore be made before any hot work is carried out in, adjacent to, or above a ballasted hold. 4.2 Procedures 4.2.1 The following are considered important procedures in respect of cargo loading: .1 the master and terminal representative should indicate agreement to the loading plan before commencement of loading by signing the plan in the spaces provided; .2 the master should state, on the agreed loading plan, the order in which the holds are to be loaded, the weight of each pour, the total weight in each hold and the amount of cargo for vessel trimming purposes, if required; .3 the terminal representative, on receipt of the ship's initial loading plan (see 3.2.1), should advise the master of the nominal loading rate at which the ship may expect to receive the cargo and the estimated time required to complete each pour; .4 where it is not practical for the ship to completely discharge its ballast water prior to reaching the trimming stage in the loading process, the master and the terminal representative should agree on the times at which loading may need to be suspended and the duration of such suspensions; .5 the loading plan should be prepared so as to ensure that all ballast pumping rates and loading rates are considered carefully to avoid overstressing the hull; .6 the quantities of cargo required to achieve the departure draught and trim should allow for all cargo on the terminal's conveyor systems to be run off and empty on completion of a loading. The terminal representative should advise the master of the nominal tonnage contained on its conveyor system and any requirements for clearing the conveyor system on completion of loading; and 92 IMSBC CODE (Amendment 06-21) and supplement 2022 EDITION

Section 4 .7 communication arrangements between the ship and terminal should be capable of responding to requests for information on the loading process and of prompt compliance in the event that the master or terminal representative orders loading to be suspended. Consideration should be given to the disposition of cargo on the conveyor systems and to the response time in the event of an emergency stop. 4.2.1 It is the master's responsibility to ensure the loading plan is prepared in accordance with the ship's loading manual. .1 For each step of the loading operation the loading plan should also show the amount of ballast and the tanks to be deballasted, the ship's draught and trim, and the calculated shear stress and bending moments . . 2 The master should carry out draught checks at regular intervals during the loading, and particularly when between about 75-90% of the cargo is loaded. The tonnage loaded should be compared with the terminal's weight figure, and adjustments to the final trimming figures determined and agreed accordingly . . 3 Any changes to the loading plan required by either terminal or ship should be made known as soon as possible and agreed by the master and terminal representative. Stresses resulting from any changes must remain within the ship's hull stress limitations . .4 High impact cargo drops and exceeding maximum load limits on tanks tops should be avoided . .5 To avoid over-stressing the ship: .5.1 Cargo should be distributed evenly within each hold and trimmed to the boundaries of the cargo space to minimize the risk of it shifting at sea . . 5.2 Cargo should not be loaded high against one hold bulkhead on one side, and low against the other . . 5.3 Each hold should be loaded using at least two separate pours per hold . . 5.4 The terminal should maintain an accurate record of the tonnages loaded in each pour into each hold . .5.5 Sudden increases in the loading rates causing significant overloading should be avoided . .6 The amount of cargo remaining on the belts depends on the loading rate at the time. This should be known by the loader operator and the terminal representative. . 7 Ship/shore communications arrangements should be confirmed when completing the ship/ shore safety checklist, giving all necessary details and contact details for both ship and terminal including: .7.1 Language and terminology to be used. .7.2 Location of telephones and terminal offices, normal communications procedures and telephone numbers . .7.3 Emergency communications procedures and telephone numbers . . 7.4 Designated port VHF channels. .8 Clarify procedures for providing the duty officer with the tonnage loaded and the loading rate as required . .9 Clarify arrangements for stops to carry out draught checks . .10 Clarify arrangements for reporting ship damage by stevedores. IMSBC CODE (Amendment 06-21) and supplement 2022 EDITION 593

nu Manual 4.2.2 The following are considered important procedures in respect of cargo unloading: .1 the terminal representative, when proposing or accepting the initial unloading plan, should advise the master of the nominal unloading rate and the estimated time required for each stage of the discharge; .2 the master should advise the hold order and the weight to be unloaded at each stage of the discharge; .3 the terminal representative should give the ship the maximum warning when it is intended to increase, or to reduce, the number of unloading heads used; and .4 communication arrangements between ship and terminal should be capable of responding to requests for information on the unloading process, and of prompt compliance in the event that the master orders unloading to be suspended. 1.2.2 The ship should provide the terminal with its proposed unloading plan in advance of the ship's arrival. 1.2.3 The terminal representative should coordinate with the master and agree upon a plan before >perations begin. 1.2.4 Agreeing the unloading plan prior to arrival simplifies matters for all concerned when the ship does trrive, as there usually is little time for the master to recalculate the unloading plan after the ship has arrived tnd is ready to commence unloading . .1 The master should ensure that the terminal representative is provided with accurate information in good time so that the loader/unloader operator can be notified of the ship's requirements. 4.3 Implementation 4.3.1 The loading or unloading plan should be prepared in a form such as that shown in appendix 2. Worked examples of this form are also shown in appendix 2. A different form may be used, provided it contains the essential information to meet the requirements of this Code. The minimum information for this purpose is that enclosed in the heavy line box on the sample form. 4.3.2 The loading or unloading plan should only be changed when a revised plan has been prepared, accepted and signed by both parties. Loading plans should be kept by the ship and terminal for a period of six months. 4.3.3 A copy of the agreed loading or unloading plan and any subsequent amendments to it should be lodged with the appropriate authority of the port State. 1.3.3 Records should be maintained in accordance with any national requirements. ,ection 5 :argo loading and handling of ballast i.1.1 i94 5.1 General 5.1.1 When the cargo loading plan is agreed, the master and terminal representative should confirm the method of cargo operations so as to ensure no excessive stresses on the hull, tank top and associated structures, and exchange information to avoid any structural damage to the ship by cargo- handling equipment. For guidance on avoidance of damage during cargo handling, see annex 2. IMSBC CODE (Amendment 06-21) and supplement 2022 EDITION

Section 5 5.1.2 The terminal representative should alert the master, when the cargo is heavy, or when the individual grab loads are large, that there may be high, localized impact loads on the ship's structure until the tank top is completely covered by cargo, especially when high free-fall drops are permitted. As such impacts have the potential for causing structural damage, special care should be taken at the start of the loading operation in each cargo hold. 5.1.2 Special care needs to be taken with heavy cargoes such as iron ore, scrap iron, lead and other concentrates. .1 The loader chute, spout or grab should be kept as close to the tank top as possible and loading should be st_?rted at a low rate until the tank top in the loading area is covered with a layer of cargo. As the pile builds up on that area the cargo will roll down the pile and slowly spread over the rest of the tank top without any heavy impact. 5.1.3 Monitoring of the cargo-handling operation, and effective communication between the terminal and ship, must be maintained at all times, and especially during final trimming of the ship. 5.1.3 Communications may be maintained by all or any of the following: .1 Direct verbal contact between the designated ship's officer and the terminal representative. .2 Portable radio communication between designated officer, terminal representative and/or loader operator . . 3 Telephone and/or easily accessible talk-back speakers on loader structure to allow surveyor/ designated ship's officer/terminal representative to speak directly with loader operator during trimming operations. 5.1.4 Any requirement for cargo trimming should be in accordance with the procedures of the IMSBC Code, or the International Grain Code, as appropriate. 5.1.4 The master, the terminal representative and the loader operators at the load port should bear the unloading of the cargo in mind while they are loading the ship. They should, where possible, avoid trimming cargo onto beams or ledges from where it will be difficult or unsafe to remove. 5.1.5 In order to effectively monitor the progress of the cargo loading operation it is essential for both the master and terminal representative to have readily accessible information on the total quantity loaded, as well as the quantities per pour. 5.1.5 Trimming pours: .1 The loading belts should be run empty before the 90% survey if there is any doubt about the quantity of cargo remaining on them . . 2 Where applicable, scale weights should be checked against the draught survey estimates of cargo loaded and cargo remaining to be loaded, and allowances made for the balance to be loaded . . 3 The quantity of cargo to be trimmed into the fore and aft holds should be delivered exactly as required to ensure the ship finishes with the required fore and aft draughts and trim. This will ensure it will be able to depart from the load port and proceed to and arrive at its unloading port safely and with the required under-keel clearance. 5.1.6 On completion of loading, the master and the terminal representative should agree in writing that the ship has been loaded in accordance with the loading plan, including any agreed variations. 5.1.6 The ship's agent should assist in preparing the necessary documentation on completion of loading. 5.2 Ship duties 5.2.1 The master should advise the terminal representative of any deviation from the deballasting plan or any other matter which may affect cargo loading. IMSBC CODE (Amendment 06-21) and supplement 2022 EDITION 595

'.U Manual 2.1 If the ship cannot deballast at the rate agreed in the loading plan, or if deballasting is causing the 1ip to list or trim incorrectly, the terminal representative should be informed in good time and arrangements ade for the suspension of loading until the ship has resolved the problem. 5.2.2 The ship should be kept upright or, if a list is required for operational reasons, it should be kept as small as possible. 5.2.3 The master should ensure close supervision of the loading operation and of the ship during final stages of loading. The master should advise the terminal representative when final trimming of the ship has to commence in order to allow for the conveyor system run-off. 2.3 It is prudent that a draught survey is carried out with about 90% of the cargo loaded. 5.3 Terminal duties 5.3.1 The terminal representative should advise the master on any change to the agreed loading rate and, at the completion of each pour, the terminal representative should advise the master of the weight loaded and that cargo loading continues in accordance with the agreed cargo plan. 3.1 The weight of the cargo being loaded should be harmonized with the ballast water being pumped Jt, so that both remain in step . .1 The rate of loading into the holds should be maintained at a steady flow. The ship should be informed of any changes . . 2 The load plan is normally designed to maintain the ship with a slight trim by the stern in order to strip out the ballast. 5.3.2 The ship should be kept upright with the cargo distributed so as to eliminate any twisting of the ship's structure. 3.2 The ship should also ensure that the ballast is discharged in accordance with the loading/unloading an. 5.3.3 The terminal should use weight meters which are well maintained and provide an accuracy to within 1 % of the rated quantity required over the normal range of loading rates. The terminal should frequently monitor the weight of cargo that is being loaded and inform the ship so that it can be compared with the cargo loading plan and the ship's calculation by draught marks. 3.3 A one per cent error on a 70,000 tonne cargo is 700 tonnes. .1 If the weigh scale is reading lower than the actual tonnage loaded, then the scale will be reading 69,300 tonnes when there are 70,000 tonnes on board. If no allowance is made for this, then it may not be possible to complete the trimming of the ship as per cargo plan . . 2 The terminal should cooperate with the master in carrying out the 90% draught survey and determining any weight meter error. Due allowance should then be made when loading the remaining balance of cargo. ection 6 lnloading cargo and handling of ballast 6.1 General 6.1.1 When the cargo unloading plan is agreed, the master and terminal representative must confirm the method of cargo operations so as to ensure no excessive stresses on the hull, tank top and associated structures, including any measures to reduce and eliminate any structural damage to the ship by cargo handling equipment. IMSBC CODE (Amendment 06-21) and supplement 2022 EDITION

Section 6 6.1.1 In addition to the avoidance of structural damage to the ship, the health and safety of ship and shore personnel should not be compromised by the adoption of any unloading practice . .1 If the ship cannot be unloaded safely by the normal unloading methods due to design features of the particular ship or the way in which the cargo was loaded, then the master and terminal representative should carry out a risk assessmentto identify a safe system of work . .2 Safety issues to be considered include: .2.1 Safe access for shore personnel; gangways should be secure with safety net fitted, adequately illuminated and with safe access from top of gangway to the deck . . 2.2 Access¬∑on deck to be confined to the outboard side only. There should be no access for anyone on the inboard side of the ship where unloading equipment is working overhead . . 2.3 Hold access ladders should be safe, secure and in good condition . . 2.4 Hold access trunks should be adequately lit. .2.5 Adequate hold lighting. Holds cannot be cleaned properly and personnel cannot work safely if the lighting provided by the ship is inadequate . . 2.6 Adequate ventilation of holds . . 2.7 The risk of overhanging cargo that could fall on personnel working underneath . . 2.8 Provision of safe access to cargo residue requires manual removal from ship's frames, pipes and structures . . 2.9 Arrangements regarding ship's crew entering holds, or lowering clean-up tools/equipment into holds while shore personnel are still working there . . 2.10 Arrangements for safe access to and erection of guard railings around hatch covers, where shore personnel have to remove spillage from top of hatch covers . . 2.11 Ship's crew to ensure that hatch covers are fully opened clear of the line of the hatch coaming and secured in position, so that grab ropes/shackles cannot catch on overhanging lips. .2.12 Geared ships to have gear swung outboard and lowered as much as possible below the unloader gantry. .2.13 Hold manhole covers and bilge cover plates should be secured flush with the tank top. Paint marks on the bulkhead indicating their position are useful to machine drivers . . 2.14 All personnel should keep well clear of the area where the unloader is working . . 2.15 Respiratory protection should be worn by both ship and shore personnel when handling dusty cargo . . 2.16 Reporting of defects - any apparent deficiency or hazard that could affect the safety of unloading operations should in the first instance be reported to the master. . 2.17 All lifting appliances and lifting gear-whether provided by ship or terminal - should be used in a safe and proper manner, and have current test and examination certificates. 6.1.2 Monitoring and effective communication between the terminal and ship must be maintained at all times. 6.1.2 Contact details and procedures should be agreed and noted in the ship/shore safety checklist. 6.1.3 On completion of unloading, the master and the terminal representative should agree in writing that the ship has been unloaded in accordance with the agreed unloading plan, with the holds emptied and cleaned to the master's requirements, and should record any detected damage suffered by the ship. IMSBC CODE (Amendment 06-21) and supplement 2022 EDITION 597

1LU Manual ,.1.3 Hold cleaning requirements are normally specified in the relevant charter party or contract of ffreightment. The holds should be cleaned to the master's satisfaction in accordance with the contractual equirements . .1 Where the ship's crew members have commenced cleaning the holds as the terminal completes unloading in each one; the terminal, when appropriate and in conformance with national regulations, should assist the ship in removing hold sweepings and unloading all the available cargo residue ashore. 6.1.4 In order to maintain an effective monitoring of the progress of the cargo unloading plan, it is essential for both the master and the terminal representative to have readily accessible information on the total unloaded quantity as well as on the quantities unloaded per hatch. 6.1.5 When ballasting one or more holds, master and terminal operator should take account of the possibility of the discharge of flammable vapours from the holds. Suitable precautions* should be taken before any hot work is permitted adjacent to or above that space. ,.1.5 This applies to combination carriers, where holds must be adequately ventilated to ensure that the tmosphere contains no flammable or noxious vapours, and is safe for personnel and heavy machinery to vork. Ref: !SCOTT (International Safety Guide for Oil Tankers and Terminals) (chapter 12). ,.1.6 During the unloading of dry bulk cargo it may be necessary to ballast one or more holds to reduce 1e cargo air draught of the ship. This is unlikely to introduce hazards if the pipeline system has been well vashed. However if a pump or pipeline has not been adequately washed, the ballasting operation may lischarge residual oil into the hold. Atmospheric tests in the hold should therefore be made before any hot vork is carried out in, adjacent to, or above a ballasted hold. 6.2 Ship duties 6.2.1 The master will advise the terminal representative of any deviation from the ballasting plan or any other matter which may affect cargo unloading. 6.2.2 At the start and during all stages of unloading cargo, the master should ensure that frequent checks are made so that: .1 cargo spaces and other enclosed spaces are well ventilated, and persons are allowed to enter them only after they have been declared safe for entry in accordance with the guidelinest developed by the Organization; .2 the cargo is being unloaded from each hold in accordance with the agreed unloading plan; .3 the ballasting operation is proceeding in accordance with the agreed unloading plan; .4 the ship is securely moored, and that weather conditions are being monitored and local weather forecasts obtained; .5 the ship's draught is read regularly to monitor the progress of the unloading; .6 the terminal representative is warned immediately if the unloading process has caused damage, has created a hazardous situation, or is likely to do so; .7 the ship is kept upright, or, if a list is required for operational reasons, it is kept as small as possible; and .8 the unloading of the port side closely matches that of the starboard side in the same hold to avoid twisting the ship. Refer to the section on the operation of combination carriers in the International Safety Guide for Oil Tankers and Terminals SGOTT). Refer to Revised recommendations for entering enclosed spaces aboard ships (resolution A.1050(27)). ;gs IMSBC CODE (Amendment 06-21) and supplement 2022 EDITION

Section 6 6.2.2 Further guidance is contained in IMO Assembly resolution A.864(20), Recommendations for entering enclosed spaces aboard ships.* Special precautions should be taken and enclosed space entry procedures observed where there is a risk of an unsafe atmosphere in ship's holds, particularly where: .1 The cargo has been fumigated en passage . . 2 The cargo has oxygen-depleting characteristics. . 3 The cargo is liable to give off flammable or toxic vapours. The terminal representative should be familiar with the IMSBC Code recommendations for the specific cargoes that the terminal handles, and also with the Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) for those materials. When employed on grain-laden ships, the terminal representative should be familiar with the International Grain Code. The terminal representative should ensure the master is made aware of: .1 Any local tidal or current conditions at the berth that could affect the safe mooring of the ship. . 2 Details of any prevailing wind conditions that could affect the safety of operations . . 3 Any forecasts of extreme wind conditions . . 4 Limiting wind or tidal conditions for berthing/unberthing . . 5 Limiting wind conditions for loader/unloader operations . . 6 Other conditions affecting operations such as wave or swell conditions, visibility, electrical storms. . 7 The effects of either heavy rainfall or drought conditions on the berth or approach channels. Appropriate safety precautions should be taken while reading ship's draughts, including: .1 Safe access along jetty edge. . 2 Wearing appropriate personnel protective equipment (including but not limited to lifejacket, safety helmet, safety boots, high visibility clothing, respiratory protection, as necessary). Hold inspections should be carried out as soon as unloading of a hold is completed and it is safe to enter. Any stevedore damage reports should be presented to the terminal representative immediately to allow the claim to be verified and agreement reached with the master concerning the arrangements to be made for its repair. The terminal representative should be informed if the ship is being listed due to the distribution of ballast, or if there are problems on board with pumping ballast. 6.2.3 The master should ensure close supervision of the final stages of the unloading, to ensure that all cargo is unloaded. 6.2.3 The master should also ensure that: .1 Adequate and proper hold lighting is provided . . 2 Bilge cover plates are properly secured so that they cannot be accidentally dislodged during hold cleaning. * Revoked by resolution A.1050(27).

LU Manual 6.3 Terminal duties 6.3.1 The terminal representative should follow the agreed unloading plan and should consult with the master if there is a need to amend the plan . . 3.1 See annex 5: Guidelines for unloading from the holds so as to minimize listing, twisting, stressing as result of cargo handling. 6.3.2 The ship is to be kept upright or, if a list is required for operational reasons, it is to be kept as small as possible . . 3.2 The cargo should be removed in a methodical pattern across the hold so that any listing to one side nd then the other is kept small and is constantly being corrected. 6.3.3 The unloading of the port side closely matches that of the starboard side in the same hold, to avoid twisting the ship . . 3.3 Where grab operations are carried out in automatic or semi-automatic mode the unloader operator 1ould: .1 Ensure the limits are set correctly for every hold . . 2 That both ship and unloader are monitored constantly for any deviation from these limits . . 3 That the pattern followed by the grab is systematic and even across the hold. 6.3.4 Unloading rates and sequences should not be altered by the terminal unless by prior consultation and agreement between the master and the terminal representative . . 3.4 Where there is significant and unavoidable delays to the unloading, or a reduction in the expected 1tes due to breakdowns or problems with the terminal materials handling system, the master should be ,formed and the plan amended as necessary. 6.3.5 The terminal representative should advise the master when unloading is considered to be completed from each hold. 6.3.6 The terminal should make every effort to avoid damage to the ship when using unloading or hold cleaning equipment. If damage does occur, it should be reported to the master and, if necessary, repaired. If the damage could impair the structural capability or watertight integrity of the hull, or the ship's essential engineering systems, the Administration or an organization recognized by it and the appropriate authority of the port State should be informed, so that they can decide whether immediate repair is necessary or whether it can be deferred. In either case, the action taken, whether to carry out the repair or defer it, should be to the satisfaction of the Administration or an organization recognized by it and the appropriate authority of the port State. Where immediate repair is considered necessary, it should be carried out to the satisfaction of the master before the ship leaves the port. ,.3.6 The master should inspect each hold as soon as possible after the completion of unloading of cargo ¬∑om the hold. Any damage found should be reported to the terminal representative immediately. ,00 6.3.7 The terminal representative should monitor the weather conditions and provide the master with the forecast of any local adverse weather condition.

rtSC.1/Circ.1357 9 June 2010 \dditional considerations for the safe loading >f bulk carriers The Maritime Safety Committee, at its eighty-seventh (12 to 21 May 2010) session, noted concern~ 1at the provisions of SOLAS chapter VI, regulation 7 (Loading, unloading and stowage of solid bulk cargoes), ;1d the Code of Practice for the Safe Loading and Unloading of Bulk Carriers (BLU Code) are not being niversally applied. In particular, the Committee noted that these concerns may be attributed to the lack of g 1utual agreement between terminal representatives and masters on appropriate loading and unloading rateJ:i ,r solid bulk cargoes to prevent over-stressing of the ship's structure. In addition, the Committee noted that an ~reed loading/unloading plan between the terminal representative and master is a mandatory requirement nder SOLAS regulation Vl/7.3. The Committee recognized the need to provide further guidance to supplement the Code of Practice, >r the Safe Loading and Unloading of /3ulk Carriers (BLU Code) and agreed to the Additional consideration~ ,r the .safe loading of bulk carriers, set out in the annex. The Committee further noted IACS Recommendation No. 46, which provides relevant guidance ;1d information on bulk cargo loading and discharging to reduce the likelihood of over-stressing the hull ructure for bulk carriers. The Committee urges Member Governments, terminal representatives, shipowners, ship operators, 1ip masters, ship charterers, shippers, .rec.~ivers and other relevant parties to consider IACS Recommendation lo. 46 and the annexed Additional consid~rations for the safe loading of bulk cctrriers when developing an ~reed loading or unloading plan in accordance with SOLAS regulation Vl/7 and the BLU Code (resolution .862(20), as amended). ~nnex 1dditional considerations for the safe loading if bulk carriers 1troduction SOLAS chapter VI, regulation 7.3 requires that before any solid bulk cargo is loaded or unloaded, 1e master and the terminal representative shall agree on a plan which shall ensure that the permissible forces ;1d moments on the ship are not exceeded during loading and unloading. To facilitate the development of the Ian, the Code of Practice for the Safe Loading and Unloading of Bulk Carriers (BLU Code) (resolution A.862(20), ; amended) is referenced. The BLU Code requires cooperation and mutual agreement between the terminal representative ;1d master with regard to how the ship is to be loaded and unloaded. The basic requirement of the Code is ;1 agreed plan detailing th~ loading, unloading, ballasting and deballasting sequences. The preparation of a Ian and maintaining control of the loading and unloading process in accordance with the plan and the BLU ode is fundamental to the safe loading of dry bulk cargoes. 14. - . - IMSBC CODE {Arneridrnent 06,-21)and supplement 2022. EDITION

MSC.1/Circ.1357 -Additional considerations for the safe loading of bulk carriers 3 The BLU Code also advises that charterers and shippers should allocate ships to terminals at which the ship will be capable of safely loading or unloading. Ships should be maintained in a sound, seaworthy condition and be free of defects that may prejudice the ships' safe loading, unloading or navigation. Terminal equipment should be properly certified, maintained and operated by duly qualified and, if appropriate, certificated personnel. All personnel, on board ships and in terminals, should be trained in all aspects of safe loading and unloading of bulk carriers commensurate with their responsibilities, including knowledge of the adverse effect that failure to comply with the agreed loading/unloading plan may have on the safety of the ship. 4 To supplement the BLU Code, guidance for terminal representatives and others involved in the handling of solid bulk cargoes is given in the Manual on Loading and Unloading of Solid Bulk Cargoes for Terminal Representatives (MSC/Circ.1160, as amended). 5 This document is intended to provide further guidance for Member Governments, terminal representatives, shipowners, ship operators, ship masters, ship charterers, shippers, receivers and other relevant parties in the loading of bulk cargoes with the aim of supporting the safe operation of ships and terminals. Time taken for loading 6 The total time to load and the nominal loading rate should be agreed to in advance of loading and should take into account the safe operational limits of the ship and the terminal. This agreement should be a part of the loading plan required under SOLAS, regulation Vl/7.3, and should also be in line with the provisions of the BLU Code. 7 While a terminal may have a high nominal loading rate (the pour rate that can be achieved by the loading equipment), the total time taken for loading will also be influenced by the steps required to safely load a ship in order to keep the structural stresses within permissible limits. Arrival condition 8 Arrival in port in a very lightly ballasted state should be avoided as such conditions can have detrimental consequences on manoeuvrability and structural strength. Manoeuvrability can b~ significantly affected by a large trim associated with a very light ballast condition, for example by increasing bodily drift and difficulty in swinging the ship in windy conditions, decreasing turning performance and increasing difficulty in maintaining the ship's course and position under the actions of wind and currents. In terms of hull structures, loading cargo in a shallow draught condition can impose high stresses in the double bottom, cross deck and transverse bulkhead structures if the cargo in the holds is not adequately supported by the buoyancy up thrust. 9 In developing the loading plan, and determining the arrival condition, consideration should be given to manoeuvrability issues and local loading criteria in the loading manual. Loading sequences I 10 The loading sequences should be agreed to in advance of loading and must take into account the safe operational limits of the ship and the terminal. This agreement should be a part of the loading plan required under SOLAS regulation Vl/7.3, and should also be in line with the provisions of the BLU Code. 11 In developing loading sequences it should be noted that in general the stress range imposed on the ship can be reduced by increasing the number of pours. 12 It is recommended that the loading sequences consist of a minimum of two pours per hold plus two trim pours. When calculating the stresses at each step consideration may be given to using a margin (i.e. using less than 100% of the permissible limit) to allow for potential over runs or decoupling of ballast synchronization; providing time to stop loading operations, and subsequently take corrective action, while remaining within permissible limits. IMSBC CODE (Amendment 06-21),and supplement.2022 EDITION 61B

BLU Manual During loading 13 BaHast operations need to be synchronized w,ith loading operations as laid down and agreed in th~ oading plan required .under SOLAS regulation Vl/7.3. Ballast and loading operations should be carried out in 1 controlled manner in accordance with the loading plan and the provisions of BLU Code. 14 If at anytime during loading the safe operational limits of the ship are exceeded, or likely to become ;o if the loading continues, the ship master has the right to suspend loading operations in order to take :orrective actions (see SOLAS regulation Vl/7.7). Consequences of failure to apply BLU Code 15 Exceeding the permissible limits specified in the ship's approved loading manual will lead to )Ver-stressing of the ship's structure ahd may result in catastrophic failure of the hull structure. 16 It is important to be aware that over-stressing of local structural members can occur even when th~ ,ull girder still water shear forces (SWSF)and bending moments (SWBM) are within their permissible limits. In his regard particular attention should be given to double bottom loading utilizing local loading diagrams in he loading manual. 17 If time for ensuring the cargo in each hold is trimmed (evenly distributed) is not included in the oading plan there is an increased risk of a.symmetric loading. Asymmetric loading in the fore-aft direction :an increase the lateral cargo pressure acting on the transverse bulkhead and increase the loads carried by he transverse bulkhead structure and the magnitude of transverse compressive stresses in the cross deck. rransverse asymmetric loading will introduce torsional loads leading to warping of the hull section giving rise o shearing and bending of the cross deck structure. 18 For more guidance please refer to IACS Recommendation No. 46, Guidance and Information on 3ulk Cargo Loading and Discharging to Reduce the Likelihood of Over-stressing the Hull Structure.

Uniform method of measurement of the density of bulk cargoes MSC/Circ.908 4 June 1999



MSC/Circ.908 4 June 1999 Uniform method of measurement of the density of bulk cargoes 1 SOLAS regulation Xll/10 (Solid bulk cargo density declaration), as adopted by the 1997 SOLAS Conference oh Bulk Carrier Safety and interpreted by operative paragraph 4 of resolution MSC.79(70), requires the shipper, prior to loading bulk cargo on a bulk carrier, to declare the density of the cargo which shall be verified by an accredited testing organization. 2 The Maritime Safety Committee, at its seventy-first session (19 to 28 May 1999), recognizing the need for a uniform method of density measurement of the bulk cargoes, adopted the performance specification for the measurement of the density of such cargoes set out at annex. 3 Member Governments are invited to bring this circular to the attention of all parties concerned. Annex Performance specification for the measurement of the density of bulk cargoes* 1 Scope 1.1 This specification may be used to determine the bulk density of bulk cargoes. 1.2 Bulk density is t.he weight of solids, air and water per unit volume. It includes the moisture content of the cargo and the voids whether filled with air or water. 1.3 The density should be expressed in kilograms per cubic metre (kg/m 3). 2 Apparatus 2.1 This specification provides for the use of a container of known volume and tare weight. 2.2 The contriner should be sufficiently rigid to prevent deformation or volume changes occurring during the test. Where the material contains lumps, or will not readily flow into corners, the container should be of cylindrical shape and/or of large size in comparison to the size of lumps. Its capacity must be large enough to contain a representative sample of the cargo for which the density is to be determined. 2.3 The internal surfaces of the container should be smooth with any attachments such as handles being fitted to the exterior. 2.4 Weighing should be done using a weighing instrument certificated by an accredited testing organization. ‚Ä¢ Refer to paragraph 1.7, representative test sample, and appendix 2, Laboratory test procedures, associated apparatus and standards, of the International Maritime Solid Bulk Cargoes Code (IMSBC Code). IMSBC CODE (Amendment 06,.21.)anH supplement 2022 EDITION 619

'v!SC/Circ.908 J J.1 J.2 1.3 J.4 J.2 Procedure A sample that is representative of the particle size, compaction and moisture of the material to be loaded on the ship should be selected. The container should be filled with a sample of the material so that it is trimmed level with the top of the container. The material should not be tamped. ¬∑ The weight of the filled container should be mea~ured and the tare weight subtracted to obtain the weight of the sample.

Lists of solid bulk cargoes for which a fixed gas fire-extinguishing system may be exempted or for which a fixed gas fire-extinguishing system is ineffective MSC.1/Circ.1395/Rev.5 28 April 2022



MSC.1/Circ.1395/Rev.5 28 April 2022 Lists of solid bulk cargoes for which a fixed gas fire-extinguishing system may be exempted or for which a fixed gas fire-extinguishing system is ineffective 1 The Maritime Safety Committee, at its sixty-fourth session (5 to 9 December 1994), agreed that there was a need to provide Administrations with guidelines regarding the provisions of SOLAS regulation 11-2/10 concerning exemptions from the requirements for fire-extinguishing systems. 2 Consequently, the Committee approved MSC/Circ.671 whereby it agreed to: .1 a list of solid bulk cargoes, for which a fixed gas fire-extinguishing system may be exempted (table 1) and recommended Member States to take into account the information contained in table 1 when granting exemptions under the provisions of SOLAS regulation 11-2/10.7.1.4; and .2 a list of solid bulk cargoes for which a fixed gas fire-extinguishing system is ineffective (table 2), and recommended that cargo spaces in a ship engaged iri the carriage of cargoes listed in table 2 be provided with a fire-extinguishing system which provides equivalent protection. The Committee also agreed that Administrations should take account of the provisions of SOLAS regulation 11-2/19.3.1 when determining suitable requirements for an equivalent fire-extinguishing system. 3 The Maritime Safety Committee, at its seventy-ninth session (1 to 10 December 2004), reviewed the above-mentioned tables and approved MSC/Circ.1146. The Committee decided that the annexed tables should be periodically reviewed and invited Member States to provide the Organization, when granting exemptions to ships for the carriage of cargoes not included in table 1, with data on the non-combustibility or fire risk properties of such cargoes. Member States were also requested to provide the Organization, when equivalent fire-extinguishing systems are required for the agreed carriage of cargoes not included in table 2, with data on the inefficiency of fixed gas fire-extinguishing systems for such cargoes. 4 The Maritime Safety Committee, at its eighty-ninth session (11 to 20 May 2011), noting the mandatory status of the IMSBC Code, reviewed the aforementioned lists of solid bulk cargoes to align certain names in the lists with those in the recent version of the IMDG Code and approved MSC.1/Circ.1395 on Lists of solid bulk cargoes for which a fixed gas fire-extinguishing system may be exempted or for which a fixed gas fire-extinguishing system is ineffective, superseding MSC/Circ.1146. The Maritime Safety Committee, at its ninety-second session (12 to 21 June 2013), approved a revision of MSC.1/Circ.1395 (MSC.1/Circ.1395/Rev.1). 5 The Maritime Safety Committee, at its ninety-fifth session (3 to 12 June 2015), considering a proposal by the Sub-Committee on Carriage of Cargoes and Containers, at its first session, approved a revision of tables 1 and 2 of MSC.1/Circ.1395/Rev.1 (MSC.1/Circ.1395/Rev.2). 6 The Maritime Safety Committee, at its ninety-eighth session (7 to 16 June 2017), considering a proposal by the Sub-Committee on Carriage of Cargoes and Containers, at its third session, approved a revision of tables 1 and 2 of MSC.1/Circ.1395/Rev.2 (MSC.1/Circ.1395/Rev.3). 7 The Maritime Safety Committee, at its 101st session (5 to 14 June 2019), considering a proposal by the Sub-Committee on Carriage of Cargoes and Containers, at its third session, approved a revision of tables 1 and 2 of MSC.1/Circ.1395/Rev.3 (MSC.1/Circ.1395/Rev.4).

Revised recommendations for entering enclosed spaces aboard ships Resolution A.1050(27) adopted on 30 November 2011



Resolution A.1050(27) adopted on 30 November 2011 Revised recommendations for entering enclosed spaces aboard ships THE ASSEMBLY, RECALLING Article 1 S(j) of the Convention on the International Maritime Organization regarding the functions of the Assembly in relation to regulations and guidelines concerning maritime safety, RECALLING ALSO its adoption, by resolution A.864(20), of the Recommendations for entering enclosed spaces aboard ships, incorporating therein recommendations for entering cargo spaces, tanks, pump-rooms, fuel tanks, cofferdams, duct keels, ballast tanks and similar enclosed spaces, BEING CONCERNED about the continued loss of life resulting from personnel entering shipboard spaces in which the atmosphere is oxygen-depleted, oxygen-enriched, toxic or flammable, BEING AWARE of the work undertaken in this regard by the International Labour Organization, Governments and segments of the private sector, HAVING CONSIDERED the recommendation made by the Maritime Safety Committee at its eighty-ninth session, 1. ADOPTS the Revised recommendations for entering enclosed spaces aboard ships, as set out in the Annex to the present resolution; 2. INVITES Governments to bring the annexed revised recommendations to the attention of shipowners, ship operators and seafarers, urging them to apply them, as appropriate, to all ships; 3. REQUESTS the Maritime Safety Committee to keep the revised recommendations under review and amend them as necessary; 4. REVOKES resolution A.864(20). Annex Revised recommendations for enteringenclosed spaces aboard ships Preamble The objective of these recommendations is to encourage the adoption of safety procedures aimed at preventing casualties to ships' personnel entering enclosed spaces where there may be an oxygen-deficient, oxygen- enriched, flammable and/or toxic atmosphere. Investigations into the circumstances of casualties that have occurred have shown that accidents on board ships are in most cases caused by an insufficient knowledge of, or disregard for, the need to take precautions rather than a lack of guidance. The following practical recommendations apply to all types of ships and provide guidance to ship operators and seafarers. It should be noted that on ships where entry into enclosed spaces may be infrequent, for example, on certain passenger ships or small general cargo ships, the dangers may be less apparent, and accordingly there may be a need for increased vigilance. IMSBC CODE (Amendment 06-21) and supplement 2022 EDITION 633

esolution A.1050(27) he recommendations are intended to complement national laws or regulations, accepted standards or articular procedures which may exist for specific trades, ships or types of shipping operations. may be impracticable to apply some recommendations to particular situations. In such cases, every ndeavour should be made to observe the intent of the recommendations, and attention should be paid to the sks that may be involved. Introduction he atmosphere in any enclosed space may be oxygen-deficient or oxygen-enriched and/or contain flammable nd/or toxic gases or vapours. Such unsafe atmospheres could also subsequently occur in a space previously >und to be safe. Unsafe atmospheres may also be present in spaces adjacent to those spaces where a hazard known to be present. Definitions .1 Enclosed space means a space which has any of the following characteristics: .1 limited openings for entry and exit; .2 inadequate ventilation; and .3 is not designed for continuous worker occupancy, nd includes, but is not limited to, cargo spaces, double bottoms, fuel tanks, ballast tanks, cargo pump-rooms, argo compressor rooms, cofferdams, chain lockers, void spaces, duct keels, inter-barrier spaces, boilers, rigine crankcases, engine scavenge air receivers, sewage tanks, and adjacent connected spaces. This list is ot exhaustive and a list should be produced on a ship-by-ship basis to identify enclosed spaces . .2 ¬∑ Adjacent connected space means a normally unventilated space which is not used for cargo but 1hich may share the same atmospheric characteristics with the enclosed space such as, but not limited to, a argo space accessway . .3 Competent person means a person with sufficient theoretical knowledge and practical experience J make an informed assessment of the likelihood of a dangerous atmosphere being present or subsequently rising in the space. :.4 Responsibleperson means a person authorized to permit entry into an enclosed space and having ufficient knowledge of the procedures to be established and complied with on board, in order to ensure that ne space is safe for entry. 1.5 Attendant means a person who is suitably trained within the safety management system, maintains . watch over those entering the enclosed space, maintains communications with those inside the space arid nitiates the emergency procedures in the event ofan ,incident occurring. Safety management for entry into enclosed spaces :.1 The safety strategy to be adopted in order to prevent accidents on entry to enclosed spaces should ,e approached in a comprehensive manner by the company. :.2 The company should ensure that the procedures for entering enclosed spaces are included among he key shipboard operations concerning the safety of the personnel and the ship, in accordance with >aragraph 7 of the International Safety Management (ISM) Code. 1.3 The company should elaborate a procedural implementation scheme which provides for training in he use of atmospheric testing equipment in such spaces and a schedule of regular onboard drills for crews. 1;3.1 Competent and responsible persons .should be trained in enclosed ¬∑space hazard recognition, Naluation, measurement, control and elimination, using standards acceptable to the Administration. i34 IMSBG EODE (Amendment 06.:.21) and supplement 2022 EDITION

Revised recommendations for entering enclosed spaces aboard ships ~.3.2 Crew members should be trained, as appropriate, in enclosed space safety, including familiarization with onboard procedures for recognizing, evaluating and controlling hazards associated with entry into enclosed spaces. 3.4 Internal audits by the company and external audits by the Administration of the ship's safety management system should verify that the established procedures are complied with in practice and are consistent with the safety strategy referred to in paragraph 3.1. 4 Assessment of risk 4.1 The company should ensure that a risk assessment is conducted to identify all enclosed spaces on board the ship. This risk assessment should be periodically revisited to ensure its continued validity. 4.2 In order to ensure safety, a competent person should always make a preliminary assessment of any potential hazards in the space to be entered, taking into account previous cargo carried, ventilation of the space, coating of the space and other relevant factors. The competent person's preliminary assessment should determine the potential for the presence of an oxygen- deficient, oxygen-enriched, flammable or toxic atmosphere. The competent person should bear in mind that the ventilation procedures for an adjacent connected space may be different from the procedures for the ventilation of the enclosed space itself. 4.3 The procedures to be followed for testing the atmosphere in the space and for entry should be decided on the basis of the preliminary assessment. These will depend on whether the preliminary asse.ssment shows that: .1 there is minimal risk to the health or life of personnel entering the space; or .2 there is no immediate risk to health or life but a risk could arise during the course of work in the space; or .3 a risk to health or life is identified. 4.4 Where the preliminary assessment indicates minimal risk to health or life or potential for a risk to arise during the course of work in the space, the precautions described in sections 5, 6, 7 and 8 should be followed, as appropriate, 4.5 Where the preliminary assessment identifies a risk to life or health, if entry is to be made, the additional precautions specified in section 9 should also be followed. 4.6 Throughout the assessment process, there should be an assumption that the space to be entered is considered to be hazardous until positively proved to be safe for entry. ¬∑ 5 Authorization of entry 5.1 No persdn should open or enter an enclosed space unless authorized by the master or the nominated responsible person and unless the appropriate safety procedures laid down for the particular ship have been followed. 5.2 Entry into enclosed spaces should be planned and the use of an entry permitsystem, which may include the use of a checklist, is recommended. An Enclosed Space Entry Permit should be issued by the master or the nominated responsible person, and completed by the personnel who enter the space prior to entry. An example of the Enclosed Space Entry Permit is provided in the appendix. 6 General precautions 6.1 Entry doors or hatches leading to enclosed spaces .should at all times be secured agairist entry, when entry is not required. IMSBC CODE (Amendn;ient 06~21)\~ng~llpplen;ient 2022 EDITION 635

Resolution A.1050(27) 6.2 A door or hatch cover which is opened to provide natural ventilation of an enclosed space niay; wrongly, be taken to be an indication of a safe atmosphere and therefore, an attendant may be stationed at the entrance or the use of a mechanical barrier, such as a rope or chain positioned across the opening with an¬∑ attached warning sign, could prevent such accidental entry. 6.3 The master or the responsible person should determine that it is safe to enter an enclosed space by ensuring that: .1 potential hazards have been identified in the assessment and as far as possible isolated qr made safe; .2 the space nas been thoroughly ventilated by natural or mechanical niearis to remove any toxic or flammable gases and to ensure an adequate level of oxygen throughout the space; .3 the atmosphere of the space has been tested as appropriate with properly calibrated instruments to ascertain acceptable levels of oxygen and acceptable levels of flammable or toxic vapours; .4 the space has been secured for entry and properly illuminated; .5 a suitable system of communication between all parties for use during entry has been agreed and tested; .6 an attendant has been instructed to remain at the entrance to the space whilst it is occupied; .7 rescue and resuscitation equipment has been positioned ready for use at the entrance to the space and rescue arrangements have been agreed; .8 personnel are properly clothed and equipped for the entry and subsequent tasks; and .9 a permit has been issued, authorizing entry. The precautions in subparagraphs .6 and .7 may not apply to every situation described in this section. The person authorizing entry should determine whether an attendant and the positioning of rescue equipment at the entrance to the space are necessary. 6.4 Only trained personnel should be assigned the duties of entering, functioning as attendants or functioning. as members of rescue teams. Ships' crews with rescue and first aid duties should be drilled periodically in rescue and first ai.d procedures. Training should include as a minimum: .1 identification of the hazards likely to be faced during entry into enclosed spaces; .2 recognition of the signs of adverse health effects caused by exposure to hazards during entry; arid .3 knowledge of personal protective equipment required for entry. 6.5 All equipment used in connection with entry should be in good worl<ing condition arid inspected prior to use. 7 Testing the atmosphere 7.1 Appropriate testing of the atmosphere of a space should be carried out with properly calibrated equipffient by persons trained in the use of the equipment. The manufacturers' instructions should be' strictly followed. Testing of the space should bEl carried out before any person enters the space and at regular intervals thereafter until all work is completed. Where appropriate, the testing of the space should be¬∑carried,out at as many different levels as is necessary to obtain a representative sample of the atmosphere in the space. In some cases it may be difficult to test the. atmosphere throughout the enclosed space without entering.the space (e.g. the bottom landing of a stairway) and this should be taken into account when assessing the risk to personnel entering the space. The use of flexible hoses or fixed sampling lines, which reach remote areas within the enclos¬∑ed space, may allow for safe testing without having to enter the space. 636 IMSBCCODt (Arnendrnent 06;;.21): ai:ad supplement 202.2 EDITION

Revised recommendations for entering enclosed spaces aboard ships 7.2 For entry purposes, steady readings of all of the following should be obtained: .1 21% oxygen by volume by oxygen content meter; Note: National requirements may determine the safe atmosphere range . . 2 not niore than 1% of lower flammable limit {LFL) on a suitably sensitive combustible gas indicator, where the preliminary assessment has determined that there is potential for flammable gases or vapours; and .3 not more than 50% of the occupational exposure limit (OEL)* of any toxic vapours and gases. If these conditions cannot be met, additional ventilation should be applied to the space and re-testing should be conducted after a suitable interval. 7.3 Any gas testing should be carried out with ventilation to the enclosed space stopped, and after conditions have stabilized, in order to obtain accurate readings. 7.4 Where the preliminary assessment has determined that there is potential for the presence of toxic gases and vapours, appropriate testing should be carried out, using fixed or portable gas or vapou,r detection equipment. The readings obtained by this equipment should be below the occupational exposure limits for the toxic gases or vapours given in accepted national or international standards, in accordance with paragraph 7.2. It should be noted that testing for flammability or oxygen content does not provide a suitable means of measuring for toxicity, nor vice versa. 7.5 It should be emphasized that the internal structure of the space, cargo, cargo residues and tank coatings may also present situations where oxygen-deficient areas may exist, and should always be suspected, even when an enclosed space has been satisfactorily tested as being suitable for entry. This is particularly the case for .spaces where the path of the supply and ou~letventilation is obstructed by structural members or cargo. 8 Precautions during entry 8.1 The atmosphere should be tested frequently whilst the space is occupied and persons should be instructed to leave the space should there be a deterioration in the conditions. ¬∑ 8.2 Persons entering enclosed spaces should be provided with calibrated and tested multi-gas detectors that monitor the levels of oxygen, carbon monoxide and other gases as appropriate. 8.3 Ventilation should continue during the period that the space is occupied and during temporary breaks. Before re-entry after a break, the atmosphere should be re-tested. In the event of failure of the ventilation system, any persons in the space should leave immediately. 8.4 Particula11 care should be exhibited when working on pipelines and valves within the space. If conditions change during the work, increased frequency of testing of the atmosphere should be performed. Changing conditions that may occur include increasing ambient temperatures, the use of oxygen-fuel torches, mobile plant, work activities in the enclosed space that could evolve vapours, work breaks, or if the ship is ballasted or trimmed during the work. 8.5 In the event of an emergency, under no circumstances should the attending crew member enter the space before help has arrived and tlie situation has been evaluated to ensure the safety of those entering the space to undertake rescue operations. Only properly trained and equipped personnel should perform rescue operations in enclosed spaces. ¬∑ ‚Ä¢ It should be noted that the term occupationalexposure limit (OEL) includes the permissibleexposure limit (PEL), maximum admissible concentration (MAC) and thresholdlimit value (ifl.:V) of any other¬∑internationally recognized terms.

Revised recommendations for entering enclosed spaces aboard ships 10.4 Use of Nitrogen as an inert gas* Nitrogen is a colourless and odourless gas that, when used as an inert gas, causes oxygen deficiency in enclosed spaces and at exhaust openings on deck during purging of tanks and void. spaces and use in cargo holds. It should be noted that one deep breath of 100% nitrogen gas will be fatal. 10.5 Oxygen-depleting cargoes and materials A prominent risk with such cargoes is oxygen depletion due to the inherent form of the cargo, for example, self-heating, oxidation of metals and ores or decomposition of vegetable oils, fish oils, animal fats, grain and other organic materials or their residues. The materials listed below are known to be capable of causing oxygen depletion. However, the list is not exhaustive. Oxygen depletion may also be caused by other materials of vegetable or animal origin, by flammable or spontaneously combustible materials and by materials with a high metal content, including, but not limited to: .1 grain, grain products and residues from grain processing (such as bran, crushed grain, crushed malt or meal), hops, malt husks and spent malt; .2 oilseeds as well as products and residues from oilseeds (such as seed expellers, seed cake,‚Ä¢dil cake and meal); .3 copra; .4 wood in such forms as packaged timber, round wood, logs, pulpwood, props (pit props and other propwood), woodchips, woodshavings, wood pellets and sawdust; .5 jute, hemp, flax, sisal, kapok, cotton and other vegetable fibres (such as esparto grass/Spanish grass, hay, straw, bhusa), empty bags, cotton waste, animal fibres, animal and vegetable fabric, wool waste and rags; .6 fish, fish meal and fish scrap; .7 guano; .8 sulphidic ores and ore concentrates; .9 charcoal, coal, lignite and coal products; .10 direct reduced iron (DRI); .11 dry ice; .12 metal wastes and chips, iron swarf, steel and other turnings, borings, drillings, shavings, filings and cuttings; and .13 scrap metal. 10.6 Fumigation When a ship is fumigated, the detailed recommendations contained in the Recommendations on the safe use of pesticides in ships (MSC.1/Circ.1358)should be followed. Spaces adjacent to fumigated spaces should be treated as if fumigated. 11 Conclusion Failure to observe simple procedures can lead to persons being unexpectedly overcome when entering enclosed spaces. Observance of the "principles and procedures outlined above will form a reliable basis for assessing risks in such spaces and for taking necessary precautions. ‚Ä¢ Refer to Guidelines on tank entry for tankers using nitrogen as an inerting medium (MSC.1/Circ.1401).

Recommendations on the safe use of pesticides in ships applicable to the fumigation of cargo holds MSC.1/Circ.1264 27 May 2008



MSC.1/Circ.1264 27 May 2008 Recommendations on the safe use of pesticides in ships applicable to the fumigation of cargo holds 1 The Maritime Safety Committee, at its sixty-second session (24 to 28 May 1993), approved the Recommendations on the safe use of pesticides in ships (MSC/Circ.612),proposed by the Sub-Committee on Containers and Cargoes at its thirty-second session. 2 The Maritime Safety Committee, at its eighty-fourth session (7 to 16 May 2008), approved the Recommendations on the safe use of pesticides in ships applicable to the fumigation of cargo holds, which apply to carriage of solid bulk cargoes including grain in pursuance of the requirement of SQLAS regulation Vl/4, proposed by the Sub-Committee on Dangerous Goods, Solid Cargoes and Containers at its twelfth session, set out in the annex. 3 The Committee agreed that the Recommendations should not apply to the carriage of fresh food produce under controlled atmosphere. 4 Member Governments are invited to bring the Recommendations to the attention of competent authorities, mariners, fumigators, fumigant and pesticide manufacturers and others concerned. 5 The present circular supersedes MSC/Circ.612, as amended by MSC/Circ.689 and MSC/Circ.746 with regard to the fumigation of cargo holds. Annex Recommendations on the safe use of pesticides in ships applicable to the fumigation of cargo holds 1 Introduction 1.1 Insect and mite pests of plant and animal products may be carried into the cargo holds with goods (introduced infestation); they may move from one kind of product to another (cross-infestation) and may rem;iin to attack subsequent cargoes (residual infestation). Their control may be required to comply with phytosanitary requirements to prevent spread of pests and for commercial reasons to prevent infestation and contamination of, or damage to, cargoes of human and animal food both raw and processed materials. Although fumigants may be used to kill rodent pests, the control of rodents on board ships is dealt with separately. In severe cases of infestation of bulk cargoes such as cereals, excessive heating may occur. 1.2 The following sections provide guidance to shipmasters in the. use of pesticides* with a view to safety of personnel. They cover pesticides used for the control of insectt and rodent pests in empty and loaded cargo holds. ‚Ä¢ The word pesticide as used througho"ut the text means fumigants. Examples of some commonly used pesticidesare listed ih appendix 1. t The word insect as used througho¬∑utthe text includes mites. IMSBC CODE (Amendment 06;.21) .and supplement 2022 EDITIQN 645

MSC.1/Circ.1264 2 Preventionof infestation 2.1 Maintenance and sanitation 2.1.1 Ship cargo holds, tank top ceilings and other parts of the ship should be kept in a good state of repair to avoid infestation. Many ports of the world have rules and by-laws dealing specifically With the maintenance of ships intended to carry grain cargoes; for example, boards and ceilings should be completely grain-tight. 2.1.2 Cleanllness, or good housekeeping, is as important a means of controlling pests on a ship as it is in a home, warehouse, mill or factory. Since insect pests on ships become established and multiply in debris, much can be done to prevent their increase by simple, thorough cleaning. Box beams and stiffeners, for example, become filled with debris during discharge of cargo and unless kept clean can become a source of heavy infestation. It is important to remove thoroughly all cargo residue from deckhead frames and longitudinal deck girders at the time of discharge, preferably when the cargo level is suitable for convenient cleaning. Where available, industrial vacuum cleaners are of value for the cleaning of cargo holds and fittings. 2.1.3 The material collected during cleaning should be disposed of, or treated, immediately so that the insects cannot escape and spread to other parts of the ship or elsewhere. In port it may be burnt or treated with a pesticide, but in many countries such material may only be landed under phyto~ sanitary supervision. If any part of the ship is being fumigated the material may be left exposed to the gas. 2.2 Main sites of infestation 2.2.1 Tank top ceiling: If, as often happens, cracks appear between the ceiling boards, food material may be forced down into the Underlying space and serve as a focus of infestation for an indefinite period. Insects bred in this space can readily move out to attack food cargoes and establish their progeny in them. 2.2.2 'Tween deck centre lines, wooden feeders and bins are often left in place for several voyages and because of their construction are a frequent source of infestation. After unloading a grain cargo, burlap and battens covering the narrow spaces between the planks should be removed and discarded before the holds are cleaned or washed down. These coverings should be replaced by new material in preparation for the next cargo. 2.2.3 Transverse beams and longitudinal deck girders which support the decks and hatch openings may have an L-shaped angle-bar construction. Such girders provide ledges where grain may lodge when bulk cargoes are unloaded. The ledges are often in inaccessible places overlooked during cleaning- operations. 2.2.4 Insulatedbulkheads near engine 0 rooms: When the hold side ofan engine-room bulkhead is insulated with a wooden sheathing, the airspace and the cracks between the boards often become filled with grain a~d other material. Sometimes the airspace is filled with insulating material which may become heavily infested and serves as a place for insect breeding. Temporary wooden bulkheads ‚Ä¢ also provide,an ideal place for insect breeding, especially under moist conditions, such as when green lumber is used. 2.2.5 Cargo battens: The crevices at the sparring deats .are ideal places for material to lodge and for insects to hide. 2.2.6 Bilges: Insects in ~ccurnulations of food material are often found in .these spaces. 2.2.7 Electrical conduit casings: Sometimes the sheet-metal covering is damaged by general cargo and when bulk grain is loaded later, the casings may become completely filled. This residual grain has. often ,been found to be heavily infested. Casings that are .damaged should be repaired immediately or, where possible, they should be replaced with steel strapping, which can be.cleaned more easily. 646 IMSBC CODE (Amendm~nt 06F21):and supplement 2022 EDITION

Recommendations on the safe use of pesticides in ships applicable to the fumigation of cargo holds 2.2.8 Other places where material accumulates and where insects breed and hide include: The area underneath burlap, which is used to cover limber boards and s9metimes to cover tank top ceilings. Boxing around pipes, especially if it is broken. Corners, where old cereal material is often found. Crevices at plate landings, frames and chocks. Wooden coverings of manholes or wells leading to double-bottom tanks or other places. Cracks in the wooden ceiling protecting the propeller shaft tunnel, Beneath rusty scale and old paint on the inside of hull plates. Shifting boards. Dunnage material, empty bags and used separation cloths. Inside lockers. 3 Chemical control of insect infestation 3.1 Methods of chemical disinfestation 3.1.1 Types of pesticides and methods of insect control 3.1.1.1 To avoid insect populations becoming firmly established in cargo holds and other parts of a ship, it is necessary to use some form of chemical toxicant for control. The materials available may be divided conveniently into two classes: contact insecticides and fumigants. The choice of agent and method of application depend on the type of commodity, the extent and location of the infestation, the importance and habits of the insects found, and the climatic and other conditions: Recommended treatments are altered or modified from time to time in accordance with new developments. 3.1.1.2 The success of chemical treatments does not lie wholly in the pesticidal activity of the agents used. In addition, an appreciation of the requirements anq limitations of the different available m~thods is required. Crew members can carry out small-scale or "spot" treatments if they aqhere to the manufacturer's instructions and take care to cover the whole area of infestation. However, extensive or hazardous treatments including fumigation and spraying near human and animal food should be placed in the hands of professional operators, who should inform the master of the identity of the active ingredients used, the hazards involved and the precautions to be taken. 3.1.2 Fumigants 3.1.2.1 Fumigants act in a gaseous phase even though they may be applied as solid or liquid formulations from which the gas arises. Effective and safe use requires that the space being treated be rendered gastight fpr the period of exposure, which may vary from a few hours to several days, depending on the fumigant type and concentration used, the pests, the commodities treated and the temperature. Additional information is provided on two of the most widely used fumigants, methyl bromide and phosphine, in appendix 1. 3.1.2.2 Since fumigant gases are poisonous to humans and require special equipment and skills in application, they should be used by speci9-listsand not by the ship's crew. 3.1.2.3 Evacuation of the spa:ce under gas treatment is mandatory and in some cases it will be necessary for the whole ship to be evacuated (see 3.3.1 and 3.3.2 below). 3.1.2.4 A "fumigator-in-charge" should be designated by the fumigation company, government agency or appropriate authority. He should be able to provide documentation to the master proving his competence and authorization. The master should be provided with written instructions by the IMSBC CODE (Amendn:ient 06;21~~ancl supplement 2022"EDI-PION

vtSC.1/Circ 1264 ¬∑ fumigator-in-charge on the type of fumigant used, the hazards to human health involved and the precautions to be take11, and, in vie)N of the highly toxic nature of all commonly used fumigants, theie should be followed carefully. Such instructions should be written in a¬∑ language readily understood by the master or his representative. t2 Disinfestationof empty cargo holds 1.2.1 An empty cargo hold may be fumigated, Examples of some commonly used pesticides are listed in appendix 1. (For prec;a,utionsbefore, during and after fumigation of cargo holds see 3.3 below.} t3 Disinfestationof cargoes and surrounds 1.3.1 Fumigation with aeration (ventilation) in port 1.3.1.1 Fumigation and aeration (ventilation}of ernpty c;argo holds should always be carried out in port (alongside or at anchorage}. Ships should not be permitted to leave port until gas-free certification has been received from the fumigator-in-charge. 1.3.1.2 Prior to the application of fumigants to cargo holds, the crew should be landed and remain ashore until the ship is certified "gas-free'', in writing, by the fumigator-in-charge or other authorized person. During this period a watchman should be posted to prevent unauthorized boarding or entry, and warning signs should be prominently displayed at gangways and at entrances to accommodation. A specimen of such a warning sign is given in appendix 2. 1.3.1.3 Thefumigator-in'"charge should be retained throughout the fumigation period and until such time as the ship is declared gas-free. 1.3.1.4 At the end of the fumigation period the fumigator will take the necessary action to ensure that the .fumigant is dispersed. If crew members are required to assist in such actions 1 for example in opening hatches, they should be provided with adequate respiratory protection and adhere strictly to instructions given by the fumigator-in-charge. 1.3.1.5 The,fumiga.tor--iA~charge should notify the master in Writing of any spaces determined to be safe for re"ottupanty by essential crew members prior to the aeration of the ship. 1.3.1.6 In such circumstances the fumigator-in--charge should monitor, throughout the fumigation and aeration periods, spaces to which persorinel have been permitted to return. Should the concentration .in any such area exceed the occupational exposure limit values set by the flag State regulations, crew members should be evacuated from the area until measurements show re-occupancy to be safe. t3.l .7 No Gnauthorized persons should be allowed 011 board until all parts of the ship have been determined gas-free, warning signs removed and clearance certificates issued by the fumigator-in-charge. : . 1.3;1.8 Clea.ranee certificates should only be issued when tests show that all residual fumigant has been dispersed from empty cargo holds and adjacent working spaces and any residual fumigant material has been removed. 1.3.1.9 Entry into a space under fumigation should never take place except in the event of an extreme emergency. If¬∑ entry is imperative the fumigator-in-charge and at least one other person should enter, each wearing adequate protective equipment appropriate for the fumiga,nt used and a safety harness and lifeline. Each. lifeline should be tended. by a person outside the space, who should be similarly equipped. 1.3.1.10 If a, clearance certificate cannot be issued after the fumigation of cargo in port, the provisions of 3.3.2 should apply. i48 IMSBCLCODE (Amend111ent 06-21) ani:I supplement 2022 EDITION

Recommendations on the safe use of pesticides in ships applicable to the fumigation of cargo holds 3.3.2 Fumigation continued in transit 3.3.2.1 Fumigation in transit should only be carried out at the discretion of the master.This should be clearly understood by owners, charterers, and all other parties involved when considering the transport of cargoes that may be infested. Due consideration should be taken of this when assessing the options of fumigation. The master should be aware of the regulations of the flag State Administration with regard to in-transit fumigation. The application of the process should be with the agreement of the port State Administration. The process may be considered under two headings: .1 fumigation in which treatment is intentionally continued in a sealed space during a voyage and in which no aeration has taken place before sailing; and .2 in-port cargo fumigation where some aeration is carried out before sail)ng, but where a clearance certificate for the cargo hold(s} cannot be issued because of residual gas and the cargo hold(s} has been re-sealed before sailing. 3.3.2.2 Before a decision on sailing with a fumigated cargo hold(s} is made it should be taken into account that, due to operational conditions, the circumstances outlined in 3.3.2.1.2 may arise.unintentionally, e.g. a ship may be required to sail at a time earlier than anticipated when the fumigation was started. In such circumstances the potential hazards may be as great as with a planned in4ransit fumigation and all the precautions in the following paragraphs should be observed. 3.3.2.3 Before a decision is made as to whether a fumigation treatment planned to be commenced in port and continued at sea should be carried out, special precautions are necessary, These include the following: .1 at least two members of the crew (including one officer} who have received appropriate training (see 3.3.2.6} should be designated as the trained representatives of the master responsible for ensuring that safe conditions in accommodation, engine-room and other working spaces are maintained after the fumigator-in-charge has handed over that responsibility to the master (see 3.3.2.12); and .2 the trained representatives of the master should brief the crew before a fumigation takes place and satisfy the fumigator-in-charge that this has been done. 3.3.2.4 Empty cargo holds are to be inspected and/or tested for leakage with instruments so that proper sealing can be done before or after loading. The fumigator-in-charge, accompanied by a trained representative of the master or a competent person, should determine whether the cargo holds to be treated are or can be made sufficiently gastight to prevent leakage of the fumigant to the accommodation, engine-rooms and other working spaces in the ship. Special attention should be paid to potential problem areas such as bilge and cargo line systems. On completion of such inspection and/or test, the fumigator-in-charge should supply to the master for his retention a signed statement that the r nspection and/or test has been performed, what provisions have been made and that the cargo holds are or can be made satisfactory for fumigation. Whenever a cargo hold is found not to be sufficiently gastight, the fumigator-in-charge should issue a sighed statement to the master and the other parties involved. 3.3.2.5 Accommodation, engine-rooms, areas designated for use in navigation of the ship, frequently visited working areas and stores, such as the forecastle head spaces, adjacent to cargo holds being subject to fumigation in transit should be treated in accordance with the provisions of 3.3.2.13. Special attention should be paid to gas concentration safety checks in problem areas referred to in 3.3.2.4. 3.3.2.6 The trained representatives of the master designated in 3.3.2.3 should be provided and be familiar with: .1 the information in the relevant Safety Data Sheet; and .2 the instructions for use, e.g. on the fumigant label or package itself, such as the recommendations ¬∑ of the fumigant manufacturer concerning methods of detection of the fumigant in air, its behaviour and hazardous properties, symptoms of poisoning, relevant first aid and spedal medical treatment and emergency procedures. IMSBC CODE (Amendment 06,.21) and supplement 2022 EDITION 649

C.1/Circ.1264 .2.7 The ship should carry: .1 gas-detection equipment and adequate fresh supplies of service items for the fumigant(s) concerned as required by 33.2.12, together with instructions for its use and the occupational exposure limit values set by the flag State regulations for safe working conditions; .2 instructions on disposal of residual fumigant material; .3 at least four sets of adequate respiratory prote.ctive equipment; and .4 a copy of the latest version of the Medical First Aid Guide for Use in Accidents Involving Dangerous Goods (MFAG), including appropriate medicines and medical equipment. :.2.8 The fumigator-in-charge should notify the master in writing of the spaces containing the cargo to be fumigated arid also of any other spaces that are considered unsafe to enter during the fumigation. During the application of the fumigant the fumigator-in-charge should ensure that the surrounding area~ are checked for safety. :.2.9 If cargo holds are to be fumigated in transit: .1 After application of the fumigant, an initial check should be. made by the fumigator-in-charge together with trained representatives of the master for any leak which, if detected, should be effectively sealed. When the master is satisfied that all precautions detailed in 3.3.2.1 to ~.3.2.12 have been fulfilled (refer to model checklist in appendix 3) then the vessel may sail. Otherwise, provisions outlined in 3.3.2.9.2 or 3.3.2.9.3 are to be followed. If the provisions of 3.3.2.9.1 are not satisfied; eithEm .2 After application of fumigants, the ship should be delayed in port alongside at a suitable berth or at anchorage for such a period as to allow the gas in the fumigated cargo holds to reach sufficiently high concentrations to detect any possible leakage. Special attention should be ¬∑ given' to those cases where fumigants in a solid or liquid form have been applied which may require a long period (normally from 4 to 7 days unless a recirculation or similar distribution system is used) to reac.h Sl!Gh a high.concentration that leakages can be detected. If leakages c1re deteGted, the ship should not sail until the source(s) of such leakages is (are) determined and eliminated. After ascertaining that the ~hip is in a safe condition to sail, i.e. no gas leakages are.present, the fumigator-in-charge shou.ld furnish the master with a written statement that: or: ¬∑ .1 the gas in the cargo hold(s) has reached sufficiently high concentrations to detect any possible ¬∑leakages; .2 spaces adjacent to the treated cargo hold(s) have been checked and found gas-free; and .3 the ship's representative is folly co.nversant with the .use of the gas-detection equipment provided. .3 After application .of the fumigants and immediately after the sailing of the ship, the fumigator.., in~tharge should remain on board for such a period as to allow the gas in the fumigated cargo hold or spaces to reach sufficiently high concentrations to detect any possible leakage, or until the fumigated cargo is discharged (see 3.3.2.20), whichever is the shorter, to check and rectify any gas leakages. Prior to his leaving the ship, he should ascertain that the ship is in a safe condition, i.e.¬∑ no gas leakages are present, and he should furnish the master with a written statement to the effect that the provisions of 3.3.2.9.2.1, 3.3.2.9.2.2 and 3.3.2.9.2.3 have been carried out. 3.2.10 On application of the fumigant, the fumigator-in;-charge should post warning signs at all entrances to, places notified to the master as in 3.3(2.8, These warning signs should indicate the identity of the fumigant and the .date.and time of fumigation,Aspecimen of such a warning sign is given in appendix 2. iO IMSBG GOOE¬∑(Amendment 0fr,21) arid supplement 2022¬∑EDITION

Recommendations on the safe use of pesticides in ships applicable to the fumigation of cargo holds 3.3.2.11 At an appropriate time after application of the fumigant, the fumigator-in-charge, accompanied by a representative of the master, should check that accommodation, engine-rooms and other working spaces remain free of harmful concentrations of gas. 3.3.2.12 Upon discharging his agreed responsibilities, the fumigator-in-charge should formally hand over to the master in writing responsibility for maintaining safe conditions in all occupied spaces. The fumigator-in-charge should ensure that gas-detection and respiratory protection equipment carried on the ship is in good order, and that adequate fresh supplies of consumable items are available to allow sampling as required in 33.2,13. 3.3.2.13 Gas concentration safety checks at all appropriate locations, which should at least include the spaces indicated in 3.32.5, should be continued throughout the voyage at least at eight-hour intervals or more frequently if so advised by the fumigator-in-charge. These readings should be recorded in the ship's log-book. 3.3.2.14 Except in extreme emergency, cargo holds sealedforfumigation in transit should never be opened at sea or entered. If entry is imperative, at least two persons should enter, wearing adequate protection equipment and a safety harness and lifeline tended by a person outside the space, similarly equipped with protective, self-contained breathing apparatus. 3.3.2.15 If it is essential to ventilate a cargo hold or holds, every effort should be made to prevent a fumigant from accumulating in accommodation or working areas. Those spaces should be carefully checked to that effect. If the gas concentration in those areas at any time exceeds the occupational exposure limit values set by the flag State regulations, they should be evacuated and the cargo hold or cargo holds should be re-sealed. If a cargo hold is re-sealed after ventilation it should not be assumed that it is completely clear of gas and tests should be made and appropriate precautions taken before entering 3.3.2.16 Prior to the arrival of the ship, generally not less than 24 hours in advance, the master should inform the appropriate authorities of the country of destination and ports of call that fumigation in transit is being carried out. The information should include the type of fumigant used, the date of fumigation, the cargo holds which have been fumigated, and whether ventilation has commenced. Upon arrival at the port of discharge, the master should also provide information as required in 3.3.2.6.2 and 3.3.2.7.2. 3.3.2.17 On arrival at the port of discharge the requirements of receiving countries regarding handling of fumigated cargoes should be established. Before entry of fumigated cargo holds, trained personnel from a fumigation company or other authorized persons, wearing respiratory protection, should carry out careful monitoring of the spaces to ensure the safety of personnel. The monitored values should be recorded in the ship's log-book. In case of need or emergency the master may commence ventilation of the fumigated cargo holds under the conditions of 3.3.2.15, having due regard for the safety of personnel on board. If this operation is to be done at sea, the master should evaluate weather and sea conditions before proceeding. 3.3.2.18 Only mechanical unloading that does not necessitate entry of personnel into the cargo holds of such fumigated cargoes"should be undertaken. However, when the presence of personnel in cargo holds is necessary for the handling and operation of unloading equipment, continuous monitoring of the fumigated spaces should be carried out to ensure the safety of the personnel involved. When necessary, these personnel should be equipped with adequate respiratory protection. 3.3.2.19 During the final stages of discharge, when it becomes necessary for personnel to enter the cargo holds, such entry should only be permitted subsequent to verification that such cargo holds are gas-free. 3.3.2.20 Upon completion of discharge and when the ship is found free of fumigants and certified as such, all warning signs should be removed. Any action in this respect should be recorded in the ship's log-book. IMSBC CODE (Amendm~nt 06-21) and supplement 2021 EDITION 651

MSC 1/Circ.1264 4 Regulations for the use of pesticides 4.1 National and international controls on pesticide usage 4.1~1 .In many countries the sale and use of pesticides are regulated by governments to ensure safety in application and prevention of c:onta.minationof foodstuffs. Among the factors taken into account in such regulatior;tsare the recommendations made by international organizations such as FAO and WHO, especially in regard to rna)(irnum limits of pesticicJe residues in food and foodstuffs. 4.1.2 , Examples of some commonly used pesticides are listed in appendix 1. Pesticides should be used 4.1.3 5 5.1 5.1.1 5.1.2 5.2 5.2.1 652 strictly in accordanc:e with the mcmufacturer's instructions as given on the label or package itself. Nc1.tional regulations and requirements vary from one country to another; therefore particular pesticides which may be used for treatment of cargo holds and accommodation in ships may be limited by the regulations and requirements of: .1 the country where the cargo is loaded or treated; .2 the country of destination of the cargo, especially in regard to pesticiae residues in foodstuffs; a:nd .3 flag State of the ship. Ships' masters should ensure that they have the necessary knowledge of the above regulations ancJ requirements. Safety, precautions- generc1I Fumigation Ship's personnel should not handle fumigants and such operations should be carried out only by qualified operators. Personnel allowed to remain in the vicinity of a fumigation operation for ii particular purpose should follow the instructions of the fumigator-in-charge implicitly. Aeration of treated cargo holds should be completed and a clearance certificate issued as in 3.3.1.8 or 3.3.1.10 before personnel are permitted to enter. Exposure to pesticides resulting in illness In the c:ase of exposure to pesticides and subsequent illness, medical advice should be sought immediately. Information on poisoning may be found in the Medical First Aid Guide for Use in Accidf::nts Involving Dangf::rous Goods (MFAG) or on the package (manufacturer's instructions and safety pr<:!c:autions on the label or the package itself}.

It should not be used in spaces where ventilation systems are not adequate for the removal of all gases from the free space. In-ship in-transit fumigations with methyl bromide should not be carried out. Fumrgation with methyl bromide should be permitted only when the ship is in the confines of a port (either at anchor or alongside) and to disinfest before discharge, once crew members have disembarked (see 3.1.2.3). Prior to discharge, ventilation must be done, forced if necessary, to reduce the gaseous residues below the occupational exposure limit values set by the flag State regulations in the free spaces. (See procedures for ventilation in 3.3.2.17 to 3.3.2.19). 3.2 Phosphine 3.2.1 A variety of phosphine-generating formulations are used for in-ship in-transit or at-berth fumigations. Application methods vary widely and include surface-only treatment, probing, perforated tubing laid at the bottom of spaces, recirculation systems and gas-injection systems or their combinations. Treatment times will vary considerably depending on the temperature, depth of cargo and on the application method used. IMSBC CODE (Amendment 06e'21l and supplement 2022 EDITION 6.53

MSC.1/Circ.1264 3.2.2 3.2.3 6.54 Any discharge of active packages producing phosphine gas represents a significant risk Jo di~ public who may encounter them at sea. It should therefore be ensured that all. waste and residuE!~ are disposed of in an appropriate manner, either by incineration or by disposal on shore, as recommended by the manufacturer. Clear written instructions must be given to the master of the ship, to the receiver of the cargo and to the authorities at the discharging port as to how any powdery residues are to be disposed of. ¬∑ These will vary with each formulation and the method of application. Prior to discharge, ventilation must be done, forced if necessary, to reduce the gaseous residues below the occupational exposurE! limit values set by the flag Sta,te regulations in thE! free sp;ic:e!'i (see proq~dLJres for ventilation in 3.3.2.17 to 3.3.2.19).

Annex Guidelines for developing and approvingprocedures for sampling, testingand controlling the moisture content for solid bulk cargoes which may liquefy Foreword These guidelines, prepared by the Maritime Safety Committee of the International Maritime Organization (IMO) contain guidance on the preparation, approval and implementation of procedures for sampling, testing and controlling moisture content for solid bulk cargoes which may liquefy. These guidelines were developed as part of the work to ensure safe transport of such cargoes and to complement the provisions of the International Maritime Solid Bulk Cargoes (IMSBC) Code related to the assessment of acceptability of consignments (see section 4 of the IMSBC Code). The main objectives of the guidelines are: to assist shippers in preparing procedures for sampling, testing and controlling moisture content as required by paragraph 4.3.3 of the IMSBC Code; and to assist competent authorities of ports of loading when approving and checking the implementation of such procedures in accordance with paragraph 4.3.3 of the IMSBC Code. 1 Introduction 1.1 The IMSBC Code establishe.s .international provisions for the safe loading, trimming, carriage and discharge of solid bulk cargoes when transported by sea, ensuring compliance with the provisions of the SOLAS Convention and identifies the risks associated with such cargoes with the aim of taking measures to minimize and to control them. IMSBC CODE (Amendment 06-21:) anti supplement 2022 EDITION 673

MSC. 1/Circ. 1454/Rev. 1 1.2 One of the risks identified is the risk associated with liquefaction of certain cargoes which may contain sufficient moisture to become fluid under the stimulus of compaction and the vibration which occurs during a voyage. Such cargoes are identified as group A cargoes in the IMSBC Code.¬∑ 1.3 Liquefaction may occur when the moisture content of the cargo exceeds the transportable moisture limit (TML). Therefore, except for ships complying with the requirements in subsection 7.3.2 of the IMSBC Code, it is particularly important to ensure that the moisture content is less than the TML of the cargo and to control its moisture content until it is on board the ship. 1.4 For this purpose, it is required by the IMSBC Code to 'determine by a test the acceptability of consignments for safe , shipment. Considering that the determination of the acceptability 1$ fundamental to avoid liquefaction during transport, the shipper should establish procedures for sampling, testing and controlling moisture conteht. These procedures should be approved and their implementation checked by the competent authority of the port of loading. 1.5 Sections 2, 3 and 4 of these guidelines contain guidance to develop such procedures for sampling, testing and the control of moisture content respectively. ¬∑ 2 Development of sampling procedures 2.1 The shipper should establish a sampling procedure to ensure that test samples used to determine the acceptability of consignments for safe shipment are representative of the consignments to be transported. Methods of sampling may vary since the character of the cargo and the form in which it is available will affect the method to be used. It is, therefore, of the utmost importance to describe accurately the sampling procedures. 2.2 The procedures should take into account the appropriate provisions of subsections 4.4 to 4.7 of the IMSBC Code. 2.3 The procedure should, at least, include provisions: to identify the consignment to be sampled; to identify the material (type, particle size distribution, composition) and to ensure that the consignment corresponds to the description of the material; to identify the appropriate time, frequency and place to take samples; to describe the method of sampling, including: - the number of subsamples or increments which are required; - the quantity of material to be taken (subsample or increment size); - the location where the subsamples or increments have to be taken in the consignment; - the method of combining the subsamples or increments‚Ä¢ to arrive at a representative sc1mple; the.method to.ensure that the moisture content of the representative sample will not be subject to variation; and - the ,method to ensure the traceability of the subsamples or increments and of the representative samples; . on the equipment used for !?ampling and procedures for its maintrnance, when necessary; to identify persons responsible for sampling and the description of their training to fulfil their responsibilities; and to identify a technical supervisor responsible for the implementation of the sampling procedures and the description of its training commensurate with its role and responsibilities. 2.4 Records of the following activities addressed in the procedure for testing should be kept and made available to the competent authority of the port of loading upon request: training; internal review to ensure that the procedure is applied correctly; q74 IMSBC CODE .(Amendment 06~2l) and supplement 2022 EDFTIO~

Guidelines for sampling, testing and controlling moisture content for solid bulk cargoes which may liquefy forms where the traceability of the subsample and representative sample is ensured; maintenance of equipment for sampling, when necessary; and any modification to the procedure for testing. Records should be kept for a period of time established by the competent authority of the port of loading in the working language of the shipper. If the language or languages used are not English, French or Spanish, a translation into one of these languages should be included. 3 Development of testing procedures 3.1 The shipper should establish a test procedure to determine the acceptability of its consignments for safe shipment. 3.2 The procedure should, at least, include: the description of the test method for determining the moisture content. Recognized international and national methods for determining moisture content for various materials are referred to in paragraph 1.1.4.4 of appendix 2 of the IMSBC Code; the description of the test method for determining the acceptability of consignments. Recommended methods for determining transportable moisture limit (TML) are given in appendix 2 of the IMSBC Code. However, it is recognized that, in some instances and taking into account the scope of each of the methods, they may not be suitable for the cargo to be transported. If the recommended methods are not suitable for the material in question, any alternative method for this material should be approved by the competent authority of the port of loading. When approving such method, the competent authority should make sure that this method gives reliable resu Its data in order to characterize the risk of liquefaction of the cargo on board the ship. It should also be established that: - the method can easily be carried out and is reproducible; - the method gives compatible results at the ship level; - the method is consistent with feedback; - the method is capable of providing a safety margin with respect to the risk of liquefaction; - the method and its related transportability criteria to ensure that the moisture content of the consignment is less than the TML; the protocol to implement the test method: the protocol should be written in the working language of the persons responsible for testing. If the language or languages used is not English, French or Spanish, a translation into one of these languages should be included. the protocol should also include a periodic ! nternal control procedure to ensure that the protocol is applied correctly: ¬∑ an example of the form where th~ consignment has to be identifiep and where the results to the test have to be reported; ¬∑ ¬∑ the list of the equipment to conduct the tests, the procedure to ensLJre the accurate calibration and maintenance of the equipment and the location(s) where the test is condu!=ted; the list of persons responsible for testing qnd the description of their training to fulfil their responsibilities; and ¬∑ the name of the te!=hnical stJpervisor designated to be respqrisib!~ fC>f the impl~mentation of the test procedure and the description of its training commensurate with its role and responsibilities.

MSC.1/Circ.1454/Rev.1 3.3 Records of the following activities addressed in the procedure for testing should be kept and made available to the competent authority of the port of loading upon request: training; internal review to ensure that the protocol is applied correctly; forms where the consignments and results are reported; maintenance, calibration and testing of any testing equipment; and any modification of the procedure for testing. Records should be kept for a period of time established by the competent authority of the port of loading in the working language of the shipper, If the l,mguage or languages used are not English, French or Spanish, a translation into one of these languages should be included. 4 Development of procedures for controlling moisture content 4.1 The snipper should establish a procedure for controlling moisture content to ensure that the moisture content is less than the TML when it is on board the ship. Once the moisture content has been measured, it is important to ensure that the moisture content remains below the TML. This procedure should be based on an analysis of all factors that may influence the moisture content between the production/extraction area and the ship. 4.2 The procedure should, at lectst, include: a description of the geographic configuration of the production/extraction area; a description of the location of the stockpiling/storage area, when applicable; a description of the method(s) to transport the consignment fr~m the production/extraction area to the stockpiling/storage area or to thEl ship and, when applicable, from the stockpiling area to the ship and a description of the precautions taken during these transport operations to control moisture co.ntent of the consignment (such as: use of closed vehicles, suspension of certain operations and conveyor belts sloped and covered during rainfall}; a description of the stockpiling/storage method(s}, when applicable and of the precautions taken during stockpiling/storage (such as configuration of the pile to allow rain to run off) to control moisture content of the consignment; a description of th.e method(s) to load the cargo from shore to ship and precautions to protect the cargo from precipitation and water ingress (see paragraph 4.3.4 when loaded from barges); a description of the sampling operations between the production/extraction area and the ship to measure and report moisture content at different stages before being on board the ship (such as during stockpiling, ccinv~yortransport, loading); a description of the conditions when the cargo is not authorized to be loaded and when the loading s.hould be suspended on board the ship (moisture content greater than the TML, weather conditions); a description of the periodic internal control procedures to ensure that the procedure for controlling moisture content is applied; and ¬∑ a description of the human and material resources and of the awareness and training activities of the personnel involved ¬∑to implement the procedure. 4.3 Records of the following activities addressed in the procedure for controlling moisture content 676 should be kept and made available to the competent authority of the port of loading upon request: training; internal review to. ensure that the procedure for controlling moisture content is applied correctly; IMSBC CODE (Amendment 06~21) and supplement 2022 EDITION

Guidance for conducting the refined MHB (CR) test MSC.1 /Circ.1600/Rev.1 28 April 2022



MSC.1 /Circ.1600/Rev.1 28 April 2022 Guidance for conducting the refined MHB (CR) test 1 The Sub-Committee on Carriage of Cargoes and Containers (CCC), at its fifth session (10 to 14 September 2018), considered submissions from Australia, Brazil, Canada, the United StaJes 1 NACf International and IIMA relating to the assessment of the Materials Hazardous only in Bulk (MF-IB) category "Corrosive Solids", for which paragraph 9.2.3.7.3 of the IMSBC Code states that the UN C.11 test* is ao acceptable test.t The UN C.1 test, however, was developed for liquids and solids that may bE!comeHqukf during transportation and had never been validated for solids. Industry experience was that the t~ f(;ISUlteclJn anomalous and highly variable results. A Global Industry Alliance (GIA) was formed underthe auspic:;es,~t:fh~ International Council on Mining and Metals (ICMM) in order to improve the assessment of solid buJk Qafg5l~ for the corrosive hazard. - 2 After an international research programme across a range of commodities, the GIA concluded that by defining and standardizing important parameters, potential sources of variation can be removed and th~ degree of variability in test outcomes can be reduced to acceptable levels. On the basis of this work, Australia, Brazil, Canada, the United States, NACE International and IIMA proposed: .1 minor changes to section 9 of the IMSBC Code, specifically paragraph 9.2.3.7.3, to enham;e the test method's applicability to the carriage of solid bulk cargoes; and .2 the issuance of guidance that extends and details the MHB test method for assessing solid bulk cargoes against the "corrosive solids: MHB (CR) hazard" as described In parc;tgraph -9.2.3,7;3 of the IMSBC Code. The guidance should be utilized by test laboratories conducting the teiit tn conjunction with the MHB (CR)¬∑test description (paragraph 9.2.3.7,3 of the IMSBC Code), 3 CCC 5 agreed, in principle, that the modifications to paragraph 9.2.3.7.3 of the IMSBC Code proposed by the submitters should be recommended for adoption in Amendment 06~21 to the IMSBC Code and that the pmpo~f.ld Interim guidani:e for implementation of the test protocol !ihould be approved by the Organization. 4 Notwithstanding the requirements that the sample contains at least 10% moisture by mass and that aluminium test coupons are used in the test specified in paragraph 9.2.3.7.3 of the IMSBC Code, the Maritim@ Safety Committee, at its 100th session (3 to 7 December 2018), approved the Interim guidance for conducting the refined MHB (CR) corrosivity test (MSC.1/Circ.1600). 5 The Maritime Safety Committee, at its 105th session (20 to 29 April 2022), approved amendments to the Interim guidance/as prepared by CCC 7, resulting from the amendments (06-21) to the IMSBC Code, adopted by resolution MSC.500(105). The amended text of the Guidance is set out in the annex. 6 Member States are invited to bring the above information arid the attached Guidance to the attention of all stakeholders, requestingthat appropriate action be taken when carrying out the MHB (CR) test, taking into account the voluntary application date of 1 January 2023 of amendments (06~21) to the IMSBC Code, pending their envisaged entry into force oh 1 December 2023. 7 This circular supersedes MSC.1/Circ.1600. ‚Ä¢ United Nations Manual of Tests ahd Ctftetia, part Iii, section 37. t The test sample shall contain at least 10% .:iiotsture by mass with water to be added to the sample in the case that the representative sample of the cargo to be shipped does not cpntain marl:\ than 10% moisture by mass. . . . ¬∑ IMSBC CODE (Amendment 06,t.Z1) ~nd)1,1ppl¬¢111ent 2022 EDITION

MSC.1 /Circ.1600/Rev.1 Annex Guidance for conducting the refined MHB (CR) test Background 1 Based on the detailed test protocol used by the Global Industry Alliance (GIA) for undertaking the refined MHB (CR) test and the points outlined in sections 3.1 to 3.3 of the GIA report (CCC 5/INF.18), general guidance for conducting the refined MH B (CR) test on any solid bulk cargo was¬∑ developed. The aim Was to ensure a clear understanding of the parameters that influence the test results and to provide advice on how to conduct the experimental procedure, given the range of physical and chemical properties of solid bulk cargoes. Introduction 2 This Guidance extends ahd details the MHB (CR) test method for assessing solid bulk cargo materials against the "corrosive solids: MHB (CR) hazard" as described in paragraph 9.2.3.7.3 of the IMSBC Code. The test should be conducted oh representative samples of the cargo at conditions representing their as-shipped properties. It should be utilized by test laboratories conducting the test in conjunction with the MHB (CR) test description (paragraph 9.2.3.7.3 of the IMSBC Code) and the UN C.1 test procedure (UN Manual of Tests arid Criteria, section 37.4). The method is an accelerated corrosion test run at 55¬∞C that assesses the resistance of carbon ste~I test coupons to. corrosion due to exposure to a solic:l bulk cargo material. The test duration should be a minimum of seven days, which may be extended to 14, 21 and 28 days, in accordance with the existing UN C.1 test protocol. Each test should be conducted to ensure acceptable repeatability. The scope of the refined MHB (CR) test is limited to and identical to that of the MHB (CR) test, as described in 9.2.3.7.3 of the IMSBC Code. Steel coupon details 3 This section specifies the ¬∑steel coupons and their preparation: 682 .1 Steel cou¬∑pon type At least three steel coupons with nominal dimensions of 20 mm x 50 mm x 2 mm should be used in each test. The type of steel should be as specified in paragraph 9.2.3.7.3 of the IMSBC Code. Aluminium coupons should not be tested, as solid bulk cargoes are not shipped in ships with holds constructed of aluminium . . 2 Grinding and cleaning The steel coupons should be progressively wet ground on both sides and on all four edges, to a minimum finish of 120 grit. The coupons should then undergo ultrasonic cleaning in deionized water, rinsed with high purity ethanol or acetone and immediately dried with high purity gas (e.g. nitrogen). No chemical surface preparation (pickling, etching, etc.) should be performed to prevent surface "irritations" (inhibition, passivation) and no cleaning performed with detergent, alkali or other proprietary means . . 3 Dimension measurements and weighing procedures Coupons should be identified with a suitable marking system in accordance with relevant international standards and best practices. Any stamped or etched regions s.hould be avoided during the assessment of localized corrosion. The dimensions of each coupon, i.e. length, width and thickness, and its weight should be recorded. The dimensions sho.uld be measurec:I to 0.1 mm. The weight should be measured to 0.0002 g. .4 Steel coupon storage After recording the dimensions and weight of each coupon, the coupons should be rinsed with high purity ethanol or acetone and dried with high purity gas. If the coupons are not ¬∑ immediately used in a test, they should be appropriately stored prior to testing (e.g. stored in IMSBC CODE (Amendment06-21) and supplement 2022 EDITION

Guidance for conducting the refined MHB (CR} test a desiccator to lower relative humidity and to avoid adventitious contamination), ensuring that coupons are kept isolated from each other. After storage and prior to testing, the coupons should again be rinsed with high purity ethanol or acetone and dried with high purity gas. Should any sign of corrosion be visible at this point, e.g. stains at the surface, th~ coupon should be wet ground again, using a minimum of 120 grit paper followed by the ultrasonic cleaning, rinsing, drying and measurement (size and weight) procedures described in paragraphs 3.2 and 3.3 above. Test set-up guidance 4 The test set-up section outlines the details of how to prepare a representative sample and load it into the test cell with coupons: .1 Sample A representative sample of the cargo should be sourced and subsampled for testing. The representative sample should be tested at typical as-shipped cargo carriage conditions including moisture content, bulk density, particle size distribution and atmospheric conditions. The shipper should provide the typical as-shipped cargo conditions or inform the laboratory when data is not available. Where pH is known to or expected to affect the testing outcome for a particular cargo material, the pH of the sample should be measured before and after testing in accordance with relevant international standards, and the pH should be reported by the laboratory. It should be ascertained that the pH during testing is representative of the material's pH in the as-shipped condition . . 2 Particle size distribution (PSD) For cargoes which only contain fine particles, the material should be tested as such. For cargoes that contain a mixture of large and fine particles, where the maximum top size is greater than 25 mm, some modification of the particle size distribution may be needed in order to fit the sample into the test vessel. If the amount of +25 mm particles is small (.--,,10%), this material can be screened at 25 mm and the finer fraction used as the representative sample for testing. If the amount of +25 mm is greater than 10%, sample reconstitution methods should be employed. Methods for both coal and bauxite are given in appendix 2 to the IMSBC Code. These should be used as guides for other cargoes that would have similar particle size distributions and therefore would need sample reconstitution approaches to be applied. For cargoes that are solely made up of coarse particles (e.g. lumpy iron ore, pig iron, hot briquetted iron, etc.) the representative sample should be crushed to achieve enough material that is -25 mm and +6.3 mm for testing. If the particle size distribution of a sample causes practical problems while executing the test, the laboratory should consult the shipper regarding its.properties and the best method to modify the particle size distribution, so that it may be adequately tested. ¬∑ .3 Moisture The ,sample should be tested at the as-shipped moisture content provided by the shipper. Based on practical experi~nce, the shipper should consider the possibility of moisture addition that may occur during loading and shipping, e.g. due to adverse weather conditions. The moisture content of the sample should be checked after completing any particle size distribution modifications (as outlined in paragraph 4.2). The moisture content of the sample should be measured just prior to testing and this should be reported . .4 Bulk density The sample, after any particle size modification has been made, should be placed into the test cell such that at least 1,5 L9f material is !JSed. For coarse or lumpy materials, the bulk density requires specific consideratlon. For such materials, a mark at a known volume is to be placed on the cell and the weight of sample that corresponds to its bulk density multiplied by that volume is to be added,to,tlie¬∑ tell such that it fills the cell to the mark. If the shipper has no IMSBC CODE (Amendment 06.:.21):ancHuppl~ment .2022 EDITION 683

MSC.1/CirC.1600/Rev.1 ¬∑ information.on the as.,.shipped bulk density of the cargo, the laboratory should determine the bulk density in accordance with applicable ISO standards, including the method described iq Uniform method for measurement of the density of bulk cargoes (MSC/Circ.908) . .5 Coupon place'ment All coupons used in the test are¬∑to be orientated in the vertical position. One coupon should be fully buried in the test sample and be placed in the sample during the loading of tne sample. One coupon should be half-buried in the top layer of the sample and be placed in thei sample during the final stages of loading the sample. The final coupon should be suspend~d in the gas phase. Placement of the buried coupon should be such that its lower edge does not touch the bottom. of the test vessE:?I. The minimum distance between the upper edge of the fully buried coupon and the top of the test sample should be 10 mm. For some coars,gr samples, the fully buried coupon may need to be placed deeper to the sample to ensure it is held in place, vertically by sufficient particles . .6 Atmosphere The test vessel with steel coupons and sample should be closed with a fi.tted glass lid equipped¬∑ with a reflux cor:id.enser. All remaining openings in the lid are to be closed using ground glass stoppers. The top of th!:! condenser is to be set to represent the atmospheric carriage conditions of the cargo bE:?ing tested. The lid is to be effectively sea.led in order to ensure: tha,t no loss of moisture occurs during the test Information on the as-shipped cargo space atmosphere should be provided to the laboratory by the shipper. For cargoes that react wrth oxygen and/or are shipped with an inert gas blanket, the test should be conducted with inert gas content and the top of the condenser closed. For cargoes where atmospheric condition~ during shipping demonstrate strong oxygen depletion, the top of the condenser may be closed to better reflect the cargo carriage conditions. In all other cases and for all other cargoes, thEa test should be conducted with an open condenser to allow for air exchange. Conducting the test 5 The test temperature (i.e. the temperature of the sample in the test vessel) should be 55¬∞C (55¬∞C ¬± 1 ¬∞q. The test vessel should be heated using an appropriate, controllable method and the temperature of the tE;lS.f: material monitored, checked and recorded regtJlarly throughout the test. Heating should be achieved evenly through the sample material and the test temperature should, where practicable, be reached within one hour. The laboratory should document the details of the heating procedure. Post-exposure treatmentof the coupons and analysis 6 Post exposure treatment of the coupons ahd analysis should be as follows: .1 At the completion of the test, the vessel should be allowed to cool to room temperature . .2 The steel coupons should be carefully recovered and any excess sample material adhering to the coupons removed by hand, followed by inhibited pickling using a suitable procedure for corroded steel toupons irt actordance With relevant international standards (e.g. ASTM G1-03) ‚Ä¢ .3 .If necessary, inhibited pickling should be repeiited, until. coupo~ mass becomes constant, as p!:!r guidam::e iri. relevant interna{ional stan.dards. .4 Both coupon surfaces are tb be photographed before and after inhibited pickling. . 5 After final cleaning with alcohol and acetone in an ultrasound bath and once dry, the test coupons should !Je weighed . .6 Disposable pl?stic gloves should b'e worn at all times when handling the test coupons. . . . . ' .7 The coupon weight should be used to determine the mass loss in grams and as a per cent of the original mass, Any inhibited pickling weight loss from unexposed carbon steel reference 684 IMSBCCODE.'(Amendn;i~nt06-21Y,and supplement 2022 EDFf;ION

Guidance for conducting the refined MHB (CR) test coupons should be subtracted. The general corrosion rate should be calculated from the mass loss, the coupon dimensions and the exposure time. Qualificationof localized corrosion 7 After removal of corrosion products, coupons are to be analysed on both sides to identify the occurrence of localized corrosion. Localized corrosion identification and qualification is to be conducted using national and/or international corrosion standards (such as NACE/ASTM G193-12d). Quantificationof localized corrosion 8 When localized corrosion occurs in tandem with, or instead of, uniform corrosion attack of the surface, the depth of the deepest intrusion should be determined. The maximum measured loss of thickness (from the general corrosion rate measured by weight loss) is to be added to the depth of the deepest intrusion to determine the intrusion depth. The deepest intrusion is to be determined metallographically or using surface profilometry or other suitable methods, as outlined in relevant nationally or internationally accepted standards, such as ISO 11463:1995 and ASTM G46.
