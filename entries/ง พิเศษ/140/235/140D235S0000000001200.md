This eases the verification process and makes it possible to identify those areas where lo ad reductions might be possible. The groups are listed below: .1 A − Hull, deck, navigation and safety services; .2 B − Propulsion service auxiliaries; .3 C − Auxiliary engine and main engine services; .4 D − Ship ' s general services; .5 E − Ventilation for engine - rooms and auxiliaries room; .6 F − Air conditioning services; .7 G − Galleys, refrigeration and laundries services; .8 H − Accommodation services; .9 I − Lighting and socket services; .10 L − Entertainment services; .11 N − Cargo loads; and .12 M − Miscellaneous. All the ship ' s loads should be delineated in the document, excluding only P AEeff , the shaft motors and shaft motors chain (while the propulsion services auxiliaries are partially included below in paragraph 4.1.2 B). Some loads (i.e. thrusters, cargo pumps, cargo gear, ballast pumps, maintaining cargo, reefers and cargo hold fans) still are included in the group for sake of transparency ; however , their service factor is zero in order to comply with paragraph 2.2.5 .6 of the Guidelines (see rows 4 and 5 of the electric power table contained in this appendix), therefore making it easier to verify that all the loads have been considered in the document and there are no loads left out of the measurement. 4.1.1 A − Hull , deck, navigation and safety services .1 loads included in the hull services typically are: ICCP systems, mooring equipment, various doors, ballasting systems, bilge systems, stabilizing equipment, etc. Ballasting systems are indicated with service fact or equal to zero to comply with paragraph 2.5.6 of the Guidelines (see row 5 of the electric power table contained in this appendix); .2 loads included in the deck services typically are: deck and balcony washing systems, rescue systems, cranes, etc.; .3 loads included in the navigation services typically are: navigation systems, navigation ' s external and internal communication systems, steering systems, etc.; and .4 loads included in the safety services typically are: active and passive fire systems, e mergency shutdown systems, public address systems, etc. 4.1.2 B − Propulsion service auxiliaries This group typically includes propulsion secondary cooling systems , such as LT cooling pumps dedicated to shaft motors, LT cooling pumps dedicated to propulsion converters, propulsion UPSs, etc. Propulsion service loads do not include shaft motors ( PTI (i) ) and the auxiliaries RESOLUTION MEPC.364(79) 2022 GUIDELINES ON THE METHOD OF CALCULATION OF THE ATTAINED ENERGY EFFICIENCY DESIGN INDEX (EEDI) FOR NEW SHIPS

Propulsion service auxiliar ies include manoeuvring propulsion equipment such as manoeuvring thrusters and their auxiliaries whose service factor is to be set to zero. 4.1.3 C – Auxiliary engine and main engine services This group includes cooling systems, i.e. pumps and fans for cooling circuits dedicated to alternators or propulsion shaft engines (seawater, technical water dedicated pumps, etc.), lubricating and fuel systems feeding, transfer, treatment and storage, ventilation system for combustion air supply, etc. 4.1.4 D – Sh ip ' s general services This group includes loads which provide general services which can be shared between shaft motor, auxiliary engines and main engine and accommodation support systems. Loads typically included in this group are cooling systems, i.e. pumping seawater, technical water main circuits, compressed air systems, freshwater generators, automation systems, etc. 4.1.5 E − Ventilation for engine - rooms and auxiliaries room This group includes all fans providing ventilation for engine - rooms and auxiliary rooms that typically are engine - rooms cooling supply - exhaust fans, auxiliary rooms supply and exhaust fans. All the fans serving accommodation areas or supplying combustion air are not included in this group. This group does not include cargo hold fans and garage supply and exhau st fans. 4.1.6 F − Air conditioning services All loads that make up the air conditioning service that typically are air conditioning chillers, air conditioning cooling and heating fluids transfer and treatment, air conditioning ' s air handling units ven tilation, air conditioning re - heating systems with associated pumping, etc. The air conditioning chillers service factor of load, service factor of time and service factor of duty are to be set as 1 ( kl=1, kt =1 and kd= 1) in order to avoid the detailed vali dation of the heat load dissipation document (i.e. the chiller ' s electric motor rated power is to be used). However, kd is to represent the use of spare chillers (e.g. four chillers are installed and one out four is spare then kd=0 for the spare chiller a nd kd= 1 for the remaining three chillers), but only when the number of spare chillers is clearly demonstrated via the heat load dissipation document. 4.1.7 G − Galleys, refrigeration and laundries services All loads related to the galleys, pantries refri geration and laundry services that typically are galleys various machines, cooking appliances, galleys ' cleaning machines, galleys auxiliaries, refrigerated room systems including refrigeration compressors with auxiliaries, air coolers, etc. 4.1.8 H − A ccommodation services All loads related to the accommodation services of passengers and crew that typically are crew and passengers ' transportation systems, i.e. lifts, escalators, etc. environmental services, i.e. black and grey water collecting, transfer, treatment, storage, discharge, waste systems including collecting, transfer, treatment, storage, etc. accommodation fluids transfe rs, i.e. sanitary hot and cold water pumping, etc., treatment units, pools systems, saunas, gym equipment, etc. RESOLUTION MEPC.364(79) 2022 GUIDELINES ON THE METHOD OF CALCULATION OF THE ATTAINED ENERGY EFFICIENCY DESIGN INDEX (EEDI) FOR NEW SHIPS

MEPC 79/ 15 /Add.1 Annex 9 , page 26 I: \ MEPC \ 79 \ MEPC 79 - 15 - Add.1 .docx 4.1.9 I − Lighting and socket services All loads related to the lighting, entertainment and socket services. As the quantity of lighting circuits and sockets within the ship may be significantly high, it is not practically feasible to list all the lighting circuits and points in the EPT for EEDI. Therefore circuits should be grouped into sub groups aimed to identify possible improvements of efficient use of power. The subgroups are: .1 Lighting for 1) cabins, 2) corridors, 3) technical rooms/stairs, 4) public spaces/stairs, 5) engine - rooms and auxiliaries ' room, 6) external areas, 7) garag es and 8) cargo spaces. All should be divided by main vertical zones; and .2 Power sockets for 1) cabins, 2) corridors, 3) technical rooms/stairs, 4) public spaces/stairs, 5) engine - rooms and auxiliaries ' room, 6) garages and 7) cargo spaces. All should be divided by main vertical zones. The calculation criteria for complex groups (e.g. cabin lighting and power sockets) subgroups are to be included via an explanatory note, indicating the load composition (e.g. lights of typical cabins, TV, hair dryer, fr idge ). 4.1.10 L – Entertainment services This group includes all loads related to entertainment services, typically public spaces audio and video equipment, theatre stage equipment, IT systems for offices, video games, etc. 4.1.11 N – Cargo loads This group will contain all cargo loads such as cargo pumps, cargo gear, maintaining cargo, cargo reefers loads, cargo hol d fans and garage fans for sake of transparency. However, the service factor of this group is to be set to zero. 4.1.12 M – Miscellaneous This group will contain all loads which have not been associated with the above - mentioned groups but still are co ntributing to the overall load calculation of the normal maximum sea load. Loads description 4.2 This identifies the loads (for example " seawater pump " ). Loads identification tag 4.3 This tag identifies the loads according to the shipyard ' s standards tagging system. For example, the " PTI1 fresh water pump " identification tag is " SYYIA/C " for an example ship and shipyard. This data provides a unique identifier for each load. Loads electric circuit i dentification 4.4 This is the tag of the electric circuit supplying the load. Such information enables the data validati on process.

MEPC 79/ 15 /Add.1 Annex 9 , page 27 I: \ MEPC \ 79 \ MEPC 79 - 15 - Add.1 .docx Loads mechanical rated power " Pm " 4.5 This data is to be indicated in the document only when th e electric load is made by an electric motor driving a mechanical load ( e.g. a fan or a pump ). This is the rated power of the mechanical device driven by an electric motor. Loads electric motor rated output power (kW) 4.6 The output power of the electric motor as per maker ' s name plate or technical specification. This data does not take part of the calculation but is usefu l to highlight potential over - rating of the combination motor - mechanical load. Loads electric motor efficiency " e " (/) 4.7 This data is to be entered in the document only when the electric load is made by an electric motor driving a mechanical load. Loads rated electric power " Pr " (kW) 4.8 Typically the maximum electric power absorbed at the load electric terminals at which the load has been designed for its service, as indicated on the maker ' s name plate and/or maker ' s technical specification. When the electric load is made by an electric motor driving a mechanical load , the load ' s rated electric power is: Pr=Pm/e (kW). Service factor of load " kl " (/) 4.9 Provides the reduction from the loads rated electric power to loads necessary electric power that is to be made when the load absorb s less power than its rated power. For example, in the case of an electric motor driving a mechanical load, a fan could be designed with some power margin, leading to the fact t hat the fan rated mechanical power exceeds the power requested by the duct system it serves. Another example is when a pump rated power exceed s the power needed for pumping in its delivery fluid circuit. Another example i s where an electric self - regulating semi - conductors heating system is oversized and the rated power exceeds the power absorbed, according a factor kl. Service factor of duty " kd " (/) 4.10 Factor of duty is to be used when a function is provided by more than one load. As all loads are to be included in the EPT for EEDI, this factor provides a correct summation of the loads. For example when two pumps serve the same circuit and they run in du ty/stand - by their k d factor will be ½ and ½. When three compressors serve the same circuit and one runs in duty and two in stand - by, then kd is 1/3, 1/3 and 1/3. Service factor of time " kt " (/) 4.11 A factor of time based on the shipyard ' s evaluation about the load duty along 24 hours of ship ' s navigation as defined at paragraph 3. For example the Entertainment loads operate at their power for a limited period of time, 4 hours out 24 hours; as a consequence kt=4/24. For example, the seaw ater cooling pumps operate at their power all the time during the navigation at Vref . As a consequence kt=1 .

Loads necessary power " Pload " (kW) 4.13 The individual user contribution to the auxiliary load power is Pload=Pr·ku. Notes 4.14 A note, as free text, could be included in the document to provide explanations to the verifier. Groups necessary power (k W) 4.15 The summation of the " Loads necessary power " from group A to N. This is an intermediate step which is not strictly necessary for the calculation of PAE . However, it is useful to allow a quantitative analysis of the PAE , providing a standard breakdown for analysis and potential improvements of energy saving. Auxiliaries load ' s power PAE (kW) 4.16 Auxiliaries load ' s power PAE is the summation of the " Load ' s necessary power " of all the loads divided by the average efficiency of the generator(s) weighted by power. PAE= Σ Pload(i) / ( average efficiency of the generator(s) weighted by power ) Layout and organization of the data indicated in the electric power table for EEDI 5 The document " Electric power table for EEDI " is to include general information (i.e. ship ' s name, project name, document references, etc.) and a table with: .1 one row containing column titles; .2 one c olumn for table row ID; .3 one c olumn fo r the groups identification ( " A " , " B " , etc.) as indicated in paragraphs 4.1.1 to 4.1.12 of this appendix; .4 one column for the group descriptions as indicated in paragraphs 4.1.1 to 4.1.12 of this appendix; .5 one column each for items in par agraphs 4.2 to 4.14 of this appendix (e.g. " load tag " ); .6 one row dedicated to each individual load; .7 the summation results (i.e. summation of powers) including data from paragraphs 4.15 to 4.16 of this appendix; and .8 explanatory notes.
