The materials should be sufficiently wide and long to give a minimum area of 150 cm 2 and should be spaced at suitable intervals (approximately 80 cm from centre to centre). If a canopy is fitted, i t should not be allowed to obscure the materials fitted on the outside of the boat, and the top of the canopy should be fitted with retro - reflective materials similar to those mentioned above and spaced at suitable intervals (approximately 80 cm centre to centre). In the case of partially enclosed or totally enclosed lifeboats, such materials should be placed, as follows: .1 for detection by horizontal light beams - at suitable intervals at half the height between the gunwale and the top of the fixed cover ; .2 for detection by vertical light beams (e.g. from helicopters) - at suitable intervals around the outer portion of the horizontal (or comparable) part of the top of the fixed cover; and .3 on the bottom of lifeboats and rescue boats which are not se lf - righting. 2 Liferafts 2.1 Retro - reflective materials should be fitted around the canopy of the liferaft. The material s should be sufficiently wide and long to give a minimum area of 150 cm 2 and should be spaced at suitable intervals (approximately 80 cm from centre to centre) at a suitable height above the waterline, doorways included, if suitable. On inflatable liferafts , retro - reflective materials should also be fitted to the underside of the floor, cross - shaped in the centre. The dimension of the cross should be half the diameter of the liferaft, and a similar cross should be applied to the top of the canopy. 2.2 On li ferafts which are not equipped with canopies, materials which should be sufficiently wide and long (to give a minimum area of 150 cm 2 ) should be attached to the buoyancy chamber at suitable intervals (approximately 80 cm from centre to centre), in such a m anner that they are visible both from the air and from a ship. 3 Lifebuoys Retro - reflective materials of a sufficient width (approximately 5 cm) should be applied around or on both sides of the body of the lifebuoy at four evenly - spaced points. 4 Buoyan t apparatus Buoyant apparatus should be fitted with retro - reflective materials in the same manner as liferafts without canopies, always depending on the size and shape of the object. Such materials should be visible both from the air and from a ship.

MSC 102 / 24/Add.1 Annex 23 , page 8 MSC 102 - 24 - Add.1.docx 4 Test methods and interpretation of test results 4.1 T est conditions and number of samples Test specimens should be conditioned for 24 hours at a temperature of 23 ± 1°C and 50 ± 5% relative humidity before being tested. All test results should be interpreted as the average obtained from testing at least three specimens. 4.2 Photometric performance The photometric performance should be measured using the general procedure recommended by CIE Report No.54, 1982. The sample dimensions should be 150 mm by 150 mm. Entrance and observation angles should be as specified in table 3.1. Readings should be taken at not greater than 30° increments as the observation half - plane is rotated about the reference axis (i.e. at rotation angles ( ε ) of 0°, 30°, 60°, 90°,120°, 150° and 180°). Each measured value should b e the average of the readings for all of the required samples. 4.3 Seawater immersion 4.3.1 Prepare a 75 mm x 150 mm test panel. (A) material without support: After removing protective liner paper, apply specimens to a clean aluminium panel surface, u sing a hand - roller for application. (B) material with support for mechanical fastening: Tape edges of test specimens to a clean aluminium panel. 4.3.2 The retro - reflective material on each test panel is cut with a sharp knife from each corner diagonal ly opposite so that an "X" is formed. The cuts must be made completely through the material to the metal panel. 4.3.3 Immerse the test panels to half - length in a 4% (by weight) saltwater solution (4 g NaCl dissolved in 96 ml distilled water) at 25°C, using a glass beaker covered by a glass plate. After a 16 - hour immersion period, remove the panels from the beaker, rinse salt deposits from the panels, and examine the sample following a 10 - minute recovery period and again after 4 hours for compliance with the requirements described in section 3.3. 4.4 Flexibility 4.4.1 Condition test specimen for 4 hours in a cold chamber at - 30°C. A 3.2 mm mandrel should be conditioned at the same tempera ture. The sample should be bent over the free - standing mandrel, gently applying gloved finger pressure. 4.4.2 For material without support, remove protective liner and talc the adhesive to prevent sticking. 4.5 Tensile strength Prepare three test sample s 25 mm in width and 150 mm in length. Insert samples into the grips or jaws of the testing machine so that the load is distributed evenly across the width of the samples and the initial test length is 100 mm. Determine tensile strength at a speed of 300 m m per minute. Record average tensile strength at break in newtons per 25 mm width for all three test samples. For material without support, remove protective liner paper before inserting samples in the tensile tester.

MSC 102 / 24/Add.1 Annex 23 , page 9 MSC 102 - 24 - Add.1.docx 4.6 Adhesive strength (for material wi thout support only) 4.6.1 Prepare three test samples 25 mm in width and 200 mm in length for each type of surface to which the material is to be applied. Remove protective liner paper for 80 mm in length and apply test specimens to the test surfaces. Test surfaces should be aluminium, GRP, each type of lifejacket and lifebuoy that the material is to be used on, and inflatable liferaft buoyancy tube material. Test surfaces should be 50 mm in width, 90 mm in length, and of the thickness normally used and sho uld be properly cleaned by wiping the surface with a suitable solvent. 4.6.2 Apply test specimens with a solid brass roller, 80 mm in diameter and 40 mm in width covered with rubber approximately 6 mm thick and having a hardness of 80 ± 1 RHD and a total mass of approximately 2 kg. Use three passes for roller application and allow to have a 120 mm free overlap strip to be used for inserting into the jaw clamp of the testing instrument. One test panel should be immersed in distilled water in a covered conta iner for 16 hours before adhesive strength testing and the other test panel should be immersed in salt water (4% NaCl by weight) in a covered container for 16 hours before adhesive strength testing ( t his test method is required only for retro - reflective ma terial that is designed for use with an adhesive. If a particular test panel used in testing results in a test failure, the retro - reflective material should not be approved for attachment to material of the type used in the test panel). Peel back at an angle of 180° at a speed of 300 mm per minute. Record adhesive strength in n ewtons per 25 mm width. Repeat the adhesive strength tests on samples subjected to the weathering test in section 4.10. 4.7 Blocking Stack two 100 mm x 100 mm pieces o f material, retro - reflective face to retro - reflective face, between two pieces of glass plate 3 mm thick of the same size as the samples and place in an air - circulating oven operating at 65°C. Place an 18 kg weight centrally on the top glass plate and clos e the oven. After 8 hours, remove the test assembly from the oven, take the retro - reflective material from between the plates and cool for 5 min . Separate the two pieces of retro - reflective material and examine for evidence of adhering or peeling of the su rface. 4.8 Salt spray resistance 4.8.1 Prepare test specimens as described in section 4.3 (A) and (B), respectively, and expose them to a salt spray chamber. 4.8.2 The test should consist of five periods of 22 hours' exposure each, separated by an inter val of 2 hours during which samples are allowed to dry. The saline mist should be produced by atomizing, at a temperature of 35 ± 2°C, a saline solution obtained by dissolving five parts of NaCl in 95 parts of water, containing not more than 0.2% of impuri ties. 4.9 Photometric performance when wet An unweathered 150 mm x 75 mm specimen should be mounted in a vertical plane, with the 150 mm dimension oriented horizontally. Apply sufficient water so that the entire specimen surface is covered by a continuous moving film of water. Measure the coefficient of retro - reflection at 0.2° observation angle and 5° entrance angle. An example of an appropriate test apparatus is shown in figure 1.

MSC 70/23/Add.1 ANNEX 6 Page 6 I:\MSC\70\23A1.WPD INTRODUCTION The tests in this Recommendation have been developed on the basis of the requirements of the International Life-Saving Appliances (LSA) Code. Life-saving appliances which are installed on board on or after 1 July 1999 should meet the applicable requirements of this Recommendation or substantially equivalent ones, as may be specified by the Administration. Where there has been a substantial change in the equipment performance requirements or the test procedures in this recommendation, an item of equipment previously tested to resolution A.521(13), or previous versions of resolution A.689(17), need only be subjected to tests affected by such changes. Life-saving appliances which were installed on board before 1 July 1999 may meet the applicable requirements of the Recommendation on Testing of Life-Saving Appliances adopted by resolution A.521(13), previous versions of resolution A.689(17), or substantially equivalent ones, as may be specified by the Administration, and may continue in use on the ship on which they are presently installed, as long as they remain suitable for service. Tests for requirements referred to in the LSA Code, which are not included in this Recommendation, should be to the satisfaction of the Administration. It should be verified that life-saving appliances not covered by tests referred to in this Recommendation meet the applicable requirements of the LSA Code. PART 1- PROTOTYPE TEST FOR LIFE-SAVING APPLIANCES 1 LIFEBUOYS 1.1 Lifebuoys specification It should be established by measurement, weighing and inspection that: .1 the lifebuoy has an outer diameter of not more than 800 mm and an inner diameter of not less than 400 mm; .2 the lifebuoy has a mass of not less than 2.5 kg; .3 if it is intended to operate the quick-release arrangement provided for a self-activated smoke signal and self-igniting light, the lifebuoy has a mass sufficient to operate such quick-release arrangement or 4 kg, whichever is greater (see 1.8); and .4 the lifebuoy is fitted with a grabline of not less than 9.5 mm in diameter and of not less than four times the outside diameter of the body of the buoy in length and secured in four equal loops. RESOLUTION MSC.81(70) (adopted on 11 December 1998) REVISED RECOMMENDATION ON TESTING OF LIFE-SAVING APPLIANCES

MSC 70/23/Add.1 ANNEX 6 Page 7 I:\MSC\70\23A1.WPD 1.2 Temperature cycling test The following test should be carried out on two lifebuoys. 1.2.1 The lifebuoys should be alternately subjected to surrounding temperatures of -30°C and +65°C. These alternating cycles need not follow immediately after each other and the following procedure, repeated for a total of 10 cycles, is acceptable: .1 an 8 h cycle at +65°C to be completed in one day; and .2 the specimens removed from the warm chamber that same day and left exposed under ordinary room conditions until the next day; .3 an 8 h cycle at -30°C to be completed the next day; and .4 the specimens removed from the cold chamber that same day and left exposed under ordinary room conditions until the next day. 1.2.2 The lifebuoys should show no sign of loss of rigidity under high temperatures and, after the tests, should show no sign of damage such as shrinking, cracking, swelling, dissolution or change of mechanical qualities. 1.3 Drop test The two lifebuoys should be dropped into the water from the height at which they are intended to be stowed on ships in their lightest seagoing condition, or 30 m, whichever is the greater, without suffering damage. In addition, one lifebuoy should be dropped three times from a height of 2 m on to a concrete floor. 1.4 Test for oil resistance One of the lifebuoys should be immersed horizontally for a period of 24 h under a 100 mm head of diesel oil at normal room temperature. After this test the lifebuoy should show no sign of damage such as shrinking, cracking, swelling, dissolution or change of mechanical qualities. 1.5 Fire test The other lifebuoy should be subjected to a fire test. A test pan 30 cm x 35 cm x 6 cm should be placed in an essentially draught-free area. Water should be put in the bottom of the test pan to a depth of 1 cm followed by enough petrol to make a minimum total depth of 4 cm. The petrol should then be ignited and allowed to burn freely for 30 s. The lifebuoy should then be moved through flames in an upright, forward, free-hanging position, with the bottom of the lifebuoy 25 cm above the top edge of the test pan so that the duration of exposure to the flames is 2 s. The lifebuoy should not sustain burning or continue melting after being removed from the flames. RESOLUTION MSC.81(70) (adopted on 11 December 1998) REVISED RECOMMENDATION ON TESTING OF LIFE-SAVING APPLIANCES

MSC 70/23/Add.1 ANNEX 6 Page 8 I:\MSC\70\23A1.WPD 1.6 Flotation test The two lifebuoys subjected to the above tests should be floated in fresh water with not less than 14.5 kg of iron suspended from each of them and should remain floating for a period of 24 h. 1.7 Strength test A lifebuoy body should be suspended by a 50 mm wide strap. A similar strap should be passed around the opposite side of the body with a 90 kg mass suspended from it. After 30 min, the lifebuoy body should be examined. There should be no breaks, cracks or permanent deformation. 1.8 Test for operation with a light and smoke signal A lifebuoy intended for quick release with a light and smoke signal should be given this test. The lifebuoy should be arranged in a manner simulating its installation on a ship for release from the navigating bridge. A lifebuoy light and smoke signal should be attached to the lifebuoy in the manner recommended by the manufacturers. The lifebuoy should be released and should activate both the light and the smoke signal. 1.9 Lifebuoy self-activating smoke signal tests 1.9.1 Nine self-activating smoke signals should be subjected to temperature cycling as prescribed in 1.2.1 and, after the tests, should show no sign of damage such as shrinking, cracking, swelling, dissolution or change of mechanical qualities. 1.9.2 After at least 10 complete temperature cycles, the first three smoke signals should be subjected to a temperature of -30ºC for at least 48 h, then taken from this stowage temperature and be activated and operated in seawater at a temperature of -1ºC and the next three smoke signals should be subjected to a temperature of +65ºC for at least 48 h then taken from this stowage temperature and be activated and operated in seawater at a temperature of +30ºC. After the smoke signals have been emitting smoke for 7 min, the smoke-emitting ends of the smoke signals should be immersed to a depth of 25 mm for 10 s. On being released the smoke signals should continue operating for a total period of smoke emission of not less than 15 min. The signals should not ignite explosively or in a manner dangerous to persons close by. 1.9.3 The last three smoke signals taken from ordinary room conditions and attached by a line to a lifebuoy should undergo the drop test into water prescribed in 1.3. The lifebuoy should be dropped from a quick-release fitting. The smoke signals should not be damaged and should function for a period of at least 15 min. 1.9.4 Smoke signals should also be subjected to the tests and examinations prescribed in 4.2.4, 4.3.1, 4.3.3, 4.5.5, 4.5.6, 4.8.2 and 4.8.3. 1.9.5 A smoke signal should be tested in waves at least 300 mm high. The signal should function effectively and for not less than 15 min. RESOLUTION MSC.81(70) (adopted on 11 December 1998) REVISED RECOMMENDATION ON TESTING OF LIFE-SAVING APPLIANCES

MSC 70/23/Add.1 ANNEX 6 Page 9 I:\MSC\70\23A1.WPD 2 LIFEJACKETS 2.1 Temperature cycling test A lifejacket should be subjected to the temperature cycling as prescribed in 1.2.1 and should then be externally examined. If the buoyancy material has not been subjected to the tests prescribed in 2.7, the lifejacket should also be examined internally. The lifejacket materials should show no sign of damage such as shrinking, cracking, swelling, dissolution or change of mechanical qualities. 2.2 Buoyancy test The buoyancy of the lifejacket should be measured before and after 24 h complete submersion to just below the surface in fresh water. The difference between the initial buoyancy and the final buoyancy should not exceed 5% of the initial buoyancy. 2.3 Fire test A lifejacket should be subjected to the fire test prescribed in 1.5. The lifejacket should not sustain burning or continue melting after being removed from the flames. 2.4 Test for oil resistance 2.4.1 The lifejacket should be tested for oil resistance as prescribed in 1.4. 2.4.2 If the buoyancy material has not been subjected to the tests prescribed in 2.7, the lifejacket should also be examined internally and the effect determined. The material must show no sign of damage such as shrinking, cracking, swelling, dissolution or change of mechanical qualities. 2.5 Tests of materials for cover, tapes and seams The materials used for the cover, tapes, seams and additional equipment should be tested to the satisfaction of the Administration to establish that they are rot-proof, colour-fast and resistant to deterioration from exposure to sunlight and that they are not unduly affected by seawater, oil or fungal attack. 2.6 Strength tests Body or lifting loop strength tests 2.6.1 The lifejacket should be immersed in water for a period of 2 min. It should then be removed from the water and closed in the same manner as when it is worn by a person. A force of not less than 3,200 N (2,400 N in the case of a child-size lifejacket) should be applied for 30 min to the part of the lifejacket that secures it to the body of the wearer (see figure 1) or to the lifting loop of the lifejacket. The lifejacket should not be damaged as a result of this test. RESOLUTION MSC.81(70) (adopted on 11 December 1998) REVISED RECOMMENDATION ON TESTING OF LIFE-SAVING APPLIANCES

MSC 70/23/Add.1 ANNEX 6 Page 12 I:\MSC\70\23A1.WPD 2.7 Additional tests for lifejacket buoyancy material other than cork or kapok The following tests should be carried out on eight specimens of lifejacket buoyancy materials other than cork or kapok. Test for stability under temperature cycling 2.7.1 Six specimens should be alternately subjected for 8 h to surrounding temperatures of -30°C and +65°C. These alternating cycles need not follow immediately after each other and the following procedure, repeated for ten cycles, is acceptable: .1 an 8 h cycle at +65°C to be completed in one day; and .2 the specimens removed from the warm chamber that same day and left exposed under ordinary room conditions until the next day; .3 an 8 h cycle at -30°C to be completed the next day; and .4 the specimens removed from the cold chamber that same day and left exposed under ordinary room conditions until the next day. 2.7.2 The dimensions of the specimens should be recorded at the end of the ten-cycle period. The specimens should be carefully examined and should not show any sign of external change of structure or of mechanical qualities. 2.7.3 Two of the specimens should be cut open and should not show any sign of internal change of structure. 2.7.4 Four of the specimens should be used for water absorption tests, two of which should be so tested after they have also been subjected to the diesel oil test as prescribed in 1.4. Tests for water absorption 2.7.5 The tests should be carried out in fresh water and the specimens should be immersed for a period of seven days under a 1.25 m head of water. 2.7.6 The tests should be carried out: .1 on two specimens as supplied; .2 on two specimens which have been subjected to the temperature cycling as prescribed in 2.7.1; and .3 on two specimens which have been subjected to the temperature cycling as prescribed in 2.7.1 followed by the diesel oil test as prescribed in 2.4. 2.7.7 The specimens should be at least 300 mm square and be of the same thickness as used in the lifejacket. Alternatively, the entire lifejacket may be subjected to the test. The dimensions should be recorded at the beginning and end of these tests. RESOLUTION MSC.81(70) (adopted on 11 December 1998) REVISED RECOMMENDATION ON TESTING OF LIFE-SAVING APPLIANCES

MSC 70/23/Add.1 ANNEX 6 Page 13 I:\MSC\70\23A1.WPD 2.7.8 The results should state the mass in kilograms which each specimen could support out of the water after one and seven days immersion (the selection of a test method suitable for obtaining this result directly or indirectly is left to the discretion of the testing authority). The reduction of buoyancy should not exceed 16% for specimens which have been exposed to the diesel oil conditioning and must not exceed 5% for all other specimens. The specimens should show no sign of damage such as shrinking, cracking, swelling, dissolution or change of mechanical qualities. 2.8 Donning test 2.8.1 As lifejackets will be used by uninitiated persons, often in adverse conditions, it is essential that risk of incorrect donning be minimized. Ties and fastenings necessary for proper performance should be few and simple. Lifejackets should readily fit various sizes of adults, both lightly and heavily clad. Lifejackets should be capable of being worn inside-out, or clearly in only one way. Test subjects 2.8.2 These test should be carried out with at least six able-bodied persons of the following heights and weights: Height Weight 1.40 m - 1.60 m 1 person under 60 kg 1 person over 60 kg 1.60 m - 1.80 m 1 person under 70 kg 1 person over 70 kg over 1.80 m 1 person under 80 kg 1 person over 80 kg .1 at least one and not more than two of the persons should be females with not more than one female in the same height range; .2 for the approval of the lifejackets, the test results obtained from each of the participating subjects should be acceptable except as provided otherwise. Clothing 2.8.3 Each test subject should be tested wearing normal clothing. The test should be repeated with the test subject wearing heavy-weather clothing. Test 2.8.4 After demonstration, the test subjects should correctly don lifejackets within a period of 1 min, without assistance.

MSC 70/23/Add.1 ANNEX 6 Page 14 I:\MSC\70\23A1.WPD Assessment 2.8.5 The observer should note: .1 ease and speed of donning; and .2 proper fit and adjustment. 2.9 Water performance tests 2.9.1 This portion of the test is intended to determine the ability of the lifejacket to assist a helpless person or one in an exhausted or unconscious state and to show that the lifejacket does not unduly restrict movement. All tests should be carried out in fresh water under still conditions. Test subjects 2.9.2 These tests should be carried out with at least six persons as described in 2.8.2. Only good swimmers should be used, since the ability to relax in the water is rarely otherwise obtained. Clothing 2.9.3 Subjects should wear only swimming costumes. Preparation for water performance tests 2.9.4 The test subjects should be made familiar with each of the tests set out below, particularly the requirement regarding relaxing and exhaling in the face-down position. The test subject should don the lifejacket, unassisted, using only the instructions provided by the manufacturer. The observer should note the points prescribed in 2.8.5. Righting tests 2.9.5 The test subject should swim at least three gentle strokes (breast stroke) and then with minimum headway relax, with the head down and the lungs partially filled, simulating a state of utter exhaustion. The period of time should be recorded starting from the completion of the last stroke until the mouth of the test subject comes clear of the water. The above test should be repeated after the test subject has exhaled. The time should again be ascertained as above. The freeboard from the water surface to the mouth should be recorded with the test subject at rest. Drop test 2.9.6 Without readjusting the lifejacket, the test subject should jump vertically into the water, feet first, from a height of at least 4.5 m. When jumping into the water, the test subject should be allowed to hold on to the lifejacket during water entry to avoid possible injury. The freeboard to the mouth should be recorded after the test subject comes to rest. Assessment 2.9.7 After each of the water tests described above, the test subject should come to rest with the mouth clear of the water by at least 120 mm. The average of all subjects' trunk angles should be at least 30° back RESOLUTION MSC.81(70) (adopted on 11 December 1998) REVISED RECOMMENDATION ON TESTING OF LIFE-SAVING APPLIANCES

The average of all subjects' faceplane (head) angles should be at least 40° above horizontal, and each individual subject's angle should be at least 30° above horizontal. In the righting test, the mouth should be clear of the water in not more than 5 s. The lifejacket should not become dislodged or cause harm to the test subject. 2.9.8 When evaluating the results of a test in accordance with 2.9.5, 2.9.7 and 2.9.8, the Administration may, in exceptional circumstances, disregard the results of a test on a subject if the results show a very slight deviation from the specified criteria, provided the Administration is satisfied that the deviation can be attributed to the unusual size and stature characteristics of the test subject and the results of tests on other subjects, chosen in accordance with 2.9.2, show the satisfactory performance of the lifejacket. Swimming and water emergence test 2.9.9 All test subjects, without wearing the lifejacket, should attempt to swim 25 m and board a liferaft or a rigid platform with its surface 300 mm above the water surface. All test subjects who successfully complete this task should perform it again wearing the lifejacket. At least two thirds of the test subjects who can accomplish the task without the lifejacket should also be able to perform it with the lifejacket. 2.10 Children's lifejacket tests As far as possible, similar tests should be applied for approval of lifejackets suitable for children. 2.10.1 When conducting water performance tests under 2.9, child-size lifejackets should meet the following requirements for their critical flotation stability characteristics. The range of sizes for child-size lifejackets, should be considered based on the test results. Devices should be sized by height or by height and weight. 2.10.2 Test subjects should be selected to fully represent the range of sizes for which the device is to be approved. Devices for smaller children should be tested on children as small as approximately 760 mm tall and 9 kg mass. At least six test subjects should be used for each 380 mm and 16 kg of size range: .1 Turning time. Each individual subject must turn face-up in not more than 5 s. .2 Freeboard. The combined results for clearance of the mouth above the water for all subjects should average at least 90 mm; each individual subject under 1,270 mm and 23 kg should have at least 50 mm clearance, and each individual subject over 1,270 mm and 23 kg should have at least 75 mm clearance. .3 Trunk angle. The average of all subjects' results should be at least 40° back of vertical, and each individual subject's result should be at least 20° back of vertical. .4 Faceplane (head) angle. The average of all subjects' results should be at least 35° above horizontal, and each individual subject's result should be at least 20° above horizontal. .5 Mobility. Mobility of the subject both in and out of the water should be given consideration in determining the acceptability of a device for approval.

However, for drop tests from heights exceeding 18 m, leakage from up to 5% of the receptacles may be accepted provided that: .1 the equipment list for the inflatable liferaft specifies the carriage of 5% excess water or means of desalination adequate to produce an equivalent amount; or .2 the water receptacles are contained in a waterproof overwrap. 5.2 Jump test 5.2.1 It should be demonstrated that a person can jump on to the liferaft, with and without the canopy erected, from a height above the floor of at least 4.5 m without damaging the liferaft. The test subject should weigh not less than 75 kg and should be wearing hard bottom shoes with smooth soles and no protruding nails. The number of jumps performed should be equal to the total number of persons for which the liferaft is to be approved. 5.2.2 The jump test may be simulated by dropping a suitable and equivalent mass, arranged so as to impact the liferaft with shoes as described in 5.2.1. 5.2.3 There should be no torn fabric or damage to seams as a result of the test. 5.2.4 Unless the configuration of both sides of a canopied reversible liferaft are identical, this test should be repeated for both sides of the liferaft. 5.3 Weight test The fully packed liferaft container should be weighed to determine whether its mass exceeds 185 kg. The weight test should be performed on the heaviest variation of the liferaft, considering different containers and equipment packs which may be used. If the mass exceeds 185 kg, the different combinations of containers and equipment packs should be weighed to determine which will and which will not exceed 185 kg. 5.4 Towing test It should be demonstrated by towing that the fully loaded and equipped liferaft is capable of being satisfactorily towed at speeds of up to 3 knots in calm water. Towing should be by a line attached to the liferafts towing connection. The sea anchor should be streamed while the liferaft is towed. The liferaft should be towed for a distance of at least 1 km. During the test the force required to tow the liferaft should be measured at speeds of 2 knots and 3 knots and recorded on the type approval certificate. 5.5 Mooring out tests The liferaft should be loaded with mass equal to the mass of the total number of persons for which it is to be approved and its equipment and moored in a location at sea or in a seawater harbour. The liferaft should remain afloat in that location for 30 days.

The liferaft should not sustain any damage that would impair its performance. After this test, the inflatable liferaft should be subjected to the pressure test prescribed in 5.17.7 and 5.17.8. 5.6 Liferaft painter system test The breaking strength of the painter system including its means of attachment to the liferaft should be as follows: .1 not less than 7.5 kN for liferafts accommodating up to 8 persons; .2 not less than 10.0 kN for liferafts accommodating 9 to 25 persons; .3 not less than 15.0 kN for liferafts accommodating more than 25 persons. 5.7 Loading and seating test The freeboard of the liferaft in the light condition, including its full equipment but no personnel, should be recorded. The freeboard of the liferaft should again be recorded when the number of persons for which the liferaft is to be approved, having an average mass of 75 kg, and each wearing an immersion suit and lifejacket, have boarded and are seated. It should be established that all the seated persons have sufficient space and headroom and it should be demonstrated that the various items of equipment can be used within the liferaft in this condition and, in the case of an inflated liferaft, with the floor inflated. The freeboard, when loaded with the mass of the number of persons for which it is to be approved and its equipment, with the liferaft on an even keel and, in the case of an inflatable liferaft, with the floor not inflated, should not be less than 300 mm. Unless the configuration of both sides of a canopied reversible liferaft are identical, this test should be repeated for both sides of the liferaft. 5.8 Boarding and closing arrangement test The boarding test should be carried out in a swimming pool by a team of not more than four persons who should be of mature age and of differing physiques as determined by the Administration. Preferably they should not be strong swimmers. For this test they should be clothed in shirt and trousers or a boiler suit and should wear approved lifejackets suitable for an adult. They must each swim about 100 m before reaching the liferaft for boarding. There must be no rest period between the swim and the boarding attempt. Boarding should be attempted by each person individually with no assistance from other swimmers or persons already in the liferaft. The water should be of a depth sufficient to prevent any external assistance when boarding the liferaft. The arrangements will be considered satisfactory if three of the persons board the liferaft unaided and the fourth boards with the assistance of any of the others. The above-mentioned test should be carried out also with persons clothed in immersion suits and lifejackets. After the boarding test, it should be demonstrated by a person clothed in an approved immersion suit that the canopy entrance can be easily and quickly closed in 1 min and can be easily and quickly opened from inside and outside in 1 min. Unless the configuration of both sides of a canopied reversible liferaft are identical, this test should be repeated for both sides of the liferaft.

MSC 70/23/Add.1 ANNEX 6 Page 31 I:\MSC\70\23A1.WPD 5.9 Stability test 5.9.1 The number of persons for which the liferaft is to be approved should be accommodated on one side and then at one end and in each case the freeboard should be recorded. Under these conditions the freeboard should be such that there is no danger of the liferaft being swamped. Each freeboard measurement should be taken from the waterline to the top surface of the uppermost main buoyancy tube at its lowest point. 5.9.2 The stability of the life raft during boarding may be ascertained as follows: Two persons, each wearing approved lifejackets, should board the empty liferaft. It should then be demonstrated that the two persons in the liferaft can readily assist from the water a third person who is required to feign unconsciousness. The third person must have his back towards the entrance so that he cannot assist the rescuers. It should be demonstrated that the water pockets adequately counteract the upsetting moment on the liferaft and there is no danger of the liferaft capsizing. 5.10 Manoeuvrability test It should be demonstrated that with the paddles provided, the liferaft is capable of being propelled when fully laden in calm conditions over a distance of at least 25 m. 5.11 Swamp test It should be demonstrated that the liferaft is fully swamped, it is capable of supporting the number of persons for which it is to be approved and remains seaworthy. The liferaft should not seriously deform in this condition. The swamped inflatable liferaft should be tested in at least 10 waves at least 0.9 m high. The waves may be produced by the wake of a boat, or by other acceptable means. During this test self-draining arrangements fitted in the floor of the liferaft are to be closed to prevent the ingress of water. Unless the configuration of both sides of a canopied reversible liferaft are identical, this test should be repeated for both sides of the liferaft. 5.12 Canopy closure test To ensure the effectiveness of the canopy closures in preventing water entering the liferaft, the efficiency of the closed entrances should be demonstrated by means of a hose test or by any other equally effective method. The requirement for the hose test is that about 2,300 1 of water per minute be directed at and around the entrances through a 63.5 mm hose from a point 3.5 m away and 1.5 m above the level of the buoyancy tubes for a period of 5 min. There should be no significant accumulation of water inside the liferaft. Unless the configuration of both sides of a canopied reversible liferaft are identical, this test should be repeated for both sides of the liferaft. 5.13 Buoyancy of float-free liferafts It should be demonstrated that the liferafts packed in containers which are float-free have sufficient inherent buoyancy to inflate the liferaft by means of the actuating line in the event of the ship sinking. The combination of equipment and container or valise should be that which produces the maximum packed weight.

The combined strength of the lifting bridle components should be at least six times the mass of the liferaft when loaded with the number of persons for which it is to be approved and its equipment. Impact test 5.16.2 The liferaft should he loaded with a mass equal to the mass of the number of persons for which it is to be approved and its equipment. With the liferaft in a free hanging position it should be pulled laterally to a position so that when released it will strike a rigid vertical surface at a velocity of 3.5 m/s. The liferaft should then be released to impact against the rigid vertical surface. After this test the liferaft should show no signs of damage which would affect its efficient functioning. Drop test 5.16.3 The liferaft, loaded as prescribed in 5.16.2, should be suspended from an on-load release at a height of 3 m above the water, be released and allowed to fall freely into the water. The liferaft should then be examined to ensure that no damage has been sustained which would affect its efficient functioning. Davit-launched liferaft boarding test 5.16.4 A davit-launched liferaft should, in addition to the boarding test prescribed in 5.8, be subjected to the following test. The liferaft, should be suspended from a liferaft launching appliance, or from a crane with a head sheave of similar height, and bowsed in to the ship's side or simulated ship's side. The liferaft should then be boarded by the number of persons for which it is to be approved of average mass 75 kg. There should be no undue distortion of the liferaft. The bowsing should then be released and the liferaft left hanging for 5 min. It should then be lowered to the sea or floor and unloaded. At least three tests are required in succession, with the hook of the lowering appliance so positioned that its distance from the ship's side is: .1 half the beam of the liferaft +150 mm; .2 half the beam of the liferaft; and .3 half the beam of the liferaft -150 mm. The boarding, which is intended to simulate actual shipboard conditions, should be timed and the time recorded.

MSC 70/23/Add.1 ANNEX 6 Page 33 I:\MSC\70\23A1.WPD 5.17 Additional tests applicable to inflatable liferafts only Damage test 5.17.1 It should be demonstrated that, in the event of any one of the buoyancy compartments being damaged or failing to inflate, the intact compartment or compartments should support, with positive freeboard over the liferaft's periphery, the number of persons for which the liferaft is to be approved. This can be demonstrated with persons each having a mass of 75 kg and seated in their normal positions or by an equally distributed mass. Righting test 5.17.2 This test is not required for a canopied reversible liferaft. For this test the liferaft should be inverted so as to simulate inverted inflation. .1 The inflatable liferaft should be loaded with its heaviest equipment pack. All of the entrances, ports, and other openings in the liferaft canopy should be open in order to allow the infiltration of water into the canopy when capsized; .2 the canopy of the liferaft should then be completely filled with water. Except for an automatically self-righting liferaft, this may be accomplished, if necessary by partially collapsing the canopy support, or alternatively the uninflated liferaft should be flaked out onto the surface of the water upside down and inflation initiated. An automatically self-righting liferaft should self-right in this condition, and should become boardable in the upright position within 1 min after the start of the test. If the inflatable liferaft, other than an automatically self-righting liferaft, does not self-right, it should be allowed to remain in an inverted position for at least 10 min before righting is attempted; .3 the righting test should be carried out by the same team of persons required for the boarding test similarly clothed and wearing lifejackets and after completing the swim required in 5.8. At least one of the persons righting the inflatable liferaft should weigh less than 75 kg. Each person should attempt to right the liferaft unaided. The water should be of sufficient depth to give no external assistance to the swimmers when mounting the inverted liferaft; .4 the righting arrangements will be considered satisfactory if each person rights the liferaft unaided. There should be no damage to the structure of the inflatable liferaft, and the equipment pack should remain secured in its place. Inflation test 5.17.3 A liferaft, packed in each type of container, should be inflated by pulling the painter and the time recorded: .1 for it to become boardable, i.e. when buoyancy tubes are inflated to full shape and diameter; .2 for the cover to be erect; and RESOLUTION MSC.81(70) (adopted on 11 December 1998) REVISED RECOMMENDATION ON TESTING OF LIFE-SAVING APPLIANCES

In the case of automatic self-righting liferaft, the liferaft should achieve total inflation and be boardable in the upright position in not more than 1 min, regardless of the orientation in which the liferaft inflates. The force required to pull the painter and start inflation should not exceed 150 N. 5.17.5 For the inflation test at -30°C the packed liferaft should be kept at room temperature for at least 24 h, then placed in a refrigerated chamber at a temperature of -30°C for 24 h prior to inflation by pulling the painter. Under these conditions the liferaft should reach working pressure in 3 min. Two liferafts should be subject to an inflation test at this temperature. There should be no seam slippage, cracking, or other defect in the liferaft and it should be ready for use after the tests. 5.17.6 For the inflation test at +65°C the packed liferaft should be kept at room temperature for at least 24 h, then placed in a heating chamber at a temperature of +65°C for not less than 7 h prior to inflation by pulling the painter. Under these conditions the gas pressure relief valves must be of sufficient capacity to prevent damage to the liferaft by excess pressure and to prevent the maximum pressure during the inflation from reaching twice the reseat pressure of the release valve. There must be no seam slippage, cracking or other defect in the liferaft. Pressure test 5.17.7 Each inflatable compartment in the liferaft should be tested to a pressure equal to three times the working pressure. Each pressure relief valve should be made inoperative, compressed air should be used to inflate the inflatable liferaft and the inflation source removed. The test should continue for at least 30 min. The pressure should not decrease by more than 5% as determined without compensating for temperature and atmospheric pressure changes, and there should be no seam slippage, cracking or other defect in the liferaft. 5.17.8 The measurement of pressure drop due to leakage can be started when it has been assumed that compartment rubber material has completed stretching due to the inflation pressure and stabilized. This test should be conducted after equilibrium condition has been achieved. RESOLUTION MSC.81(70) (adopted on 11 December 1998) REVISED RECOMMENDATION ON TESTING OF LIFE-SAVING APPLIANCES

In the case of metal lifeboats, the testing should stop at 25% overload. The weights for the various overload conditions should be distributed in proportion to the loading of the lifeboat in its service condition, but the weights used to represent the persons need not be placed 300 mm above the seatpan. Testing by filling the lifeboat with water should not be accepted as this method of loading does not give the proper distribution of weight. Machinery may be removed in order to avoid damage to it, in which case weights should be added to the lifeboat to compensate for the removal of such machinery. At each incremental overload, the measurements required in 6.3.4 should be made. 6.3.4 The following should be measured and recorded at each condition of load specified in 6.3.1 through 6.3.3: .1 deflection of keel amidships; .2 change in length as measured between the top of stem and stern posts; .3 change in breadth over the gunwale at the quarter length forward, amidships and the quarter length aft; and .4 change in depth measured from gunwale to keel. 6.3.5 The keel deflection and change in breadth in 6.3.4.1 and 6.3.4.3 should not exceed 1/400 of the lifeboat's length when the lifeboat is subjected to 25% overload; the results at 100% overload, if required by 6.3.3, should be approximately in proportion to those obtained at 25% overload. 6.3.6 The weights should then be removed and the dimensions of the lifeboat checked. No significant residual deflection should result. Any permanent deflection as a result of these tests should be recorded. If the lifeboat is made of GRP, such measurement should be taken after a lapse of time sufficient to permit the GRP to recover its original form (approximately 18 h).

If the lifeboat is normally ramp-launched, and a ramp is not available, this test may be conducted by dropping the lifeboat vertically with the keel at the same angle that normally occurs during water entry. 6.3.8 After this test the lifeboat should be unloaded, cleaned and carefully examined to detect the position and extent of damage that may have occurred as a result of this test. An operational test should then be conducted in accordance with 6.10.1.

As a minimum, the dimensions and mass of the lifeboat, the location of its centre-of-gravity, and its second moment of mass, must be scaled in a reasonable manner. Depending on the construction and behaviour of the free-fall lifeboat, other parameters may also have to be reasonably scaled to effect correct behaviour of the model. If models are used, sufficient full-scale tests should be conducted to verify the accuracy of the model measurements. As a minimum, the following full-scale tests should be conducted with the ship on an even keel using the same type of launching arrangement as the production lifeboat and from the height for which the lifeboat is to be approved: .1 lifeboat fully loaded; .2 lifeboat loaded with its required equipment and minimum launching crew only; .3 lifeboat loaded with its required equipment and one half of the full complement of persons distributed in the forward half of the seating positions of the lifeboat; and .4 lifeboat loaded with its required equipment and one half of the full complement of persons seated in the after half of the seating positions of the lifeboat.

The weight used to represent each person, assumed to have an average mass of 75 kg, should be secured at each seat location and have its centre of gravity approximately 300 mm above the seatpan so as to have the same effect on stability as when the lifeboat is loaded with the number of persons for which it is to be approved; and .2 when the lifeboat is in the light condition. 6.14.2 At the beginning of these tests, the engine should be running in neutral position and: .1 unless arranged to stop automatically when inverted, the engine should continue to run when inverted and for 30 min after the lifeboat has returned to the upright position; .2 if the engine is arranged to stop automatically when inverted, it should be easily restarted and run for 30 min after the lifeboat has returned to the upright position. Flooded capsizing test 6.14.3 The lifeboat should be placed in the water and fully flooded until the lifeboat can contain no additional water. All entrances and openings should be secured to remain open during the test. 6.14.4 Using a suitable means, the lifeboat should be rotated about a longitudinal axis to a heel angle of 180° and then released. After release, the lifeboat should attain a position that provides an above-water escape for the occupants. 6.14.5 For the purpose of this test, the mass and distribution of the occupants may be disregarded. However, the equipment, or equivalent mass, should be secured in the lifeboat in the normal operating position. Engine inversion test 6.14.6 The engine and its fuel tank should be mounted on a frame that is arranged to rotate about an axis equivalent to the longitudinal axis of the boat. A pan should be located under the engine to collect any oil which may leak from the engine so that the quantity of such oil can be measured. 6.14.7 The following procedure should be followed during this test: .1 start the engine and run it at full speed for 5 min; .2 stop the engine and rotate it in a clockwise direction through 360°; .3 restart the engine and run it at full speed for 10 min; .4 stop the engine and rotate it in a counter-clockwise direction through 360°; .5 restart the engine, run it at full speed for 10 min, and then stop the engine; .6 allow the engine to cool; RESOLUTION MSC.81(70) (adopted on 11 December 1998) REVISED RECOMMENDATION ON TESTING OF LIFE-SAVING APPLIANCES

When examined after being dismantled the engine should show no evidence of overheating or excessive wear. 6.15 Air supply test for lifeboats with a self-contained air support system All entrances and openings of the lifeboat should be closed, the air supply to the inside of the lifeboat turned on and the engine run at full speed for a period of 10 min. During this time the atmospheric pressure within the enclosure should be continuously monitored to ascertain that a small positive air pressure is maintained within the lifeboat and to confirm that noxious gases cannot enter. Even if the engine should stop, the internal air pressure should never fall below the outside atmospheric pressure nor should it exceed outside atmospheric pressure by more than 20 mbar during the test. It should be ascertained that when the air supply is depleted automatic means are activated to prevent dangerously low pressure being developed within the lifeboat. 6.16 Additional tests for fire-protected lifeboats Fire test 6.16.1 The lifeboat should be moored in the centre of an area which is not less than five times the maximum projected plan area of the lifeboat. Sufficient kerosene should be floated on the water within the area so that when ignited it will sustain a fire which completely envelops the lifeboat for the period of time specified in 6.16.3. The boundary of the area should be capable of completely retaining the fuel. RESOLUTION MSC.81(70) (adopted on 11 December 1998) REVISED RECOMMENDATION ON TESTING OF LIFE-SAVING APPLIANCES

The gas- and fire-protective systems should be in operation throughout the fire test. 6.16.3 The kerosene should be ignited. It should continue to burn and envelop the lifeboat for 8 min. 6.16.4 During the fire test, the temperature should be measured and recorded as a minimum at the following locations: .1 at not less than 10 positions on the inside surface of the lifeboat; .2 at not less than five positions inside the lifeboat at locations normally taken by occupants and away from the inside surface; and .3 on the external surface of the lifeboat. The positions of such temperature recorders should be to the satisfaction of the Administration. The method of temperature measurement should allow the maximum temperature to be recorded. 6.16.5 The atmosphere inside the lifeboat should be continuously sampled and representative retained samples should be analysed for the presence and quantity of essential, toxic, and injurious gases or substances. The analysis should cover the range of anticipated gases or substances that may be produced and which can vary according to the materials and fabrication techniques used to manufacture the lifeboat. The analysis should indicate that there is sufficient oxygen and no dangerous levels of toxic or injurious gases or substances. 6.16.6 The pressure inside the lifeboat should be continuously recorded to confirm that a positive pressure is being maintained inside the lifeboat. 6.16.7 At the conclusion of the fire test, the condition of the lifeboat should be such that it could continue to be used in the fully-loaded condition. Note : The Administration may waive this test for any totally enclosed lifeboat which is identical in construction to another lifeboat which has successfully completed this test, provided the lifeboat differs only in size, and retains essentially the same form. The protective system should be as effective as that of the lifeboat tested. The water delivery rate and film thickness at various locations around the hull and canopy should be equal to or exceed the measurements made on the lifeboat originally fire tested. Water spray tests 6.16.8 Start the engine and the spray pump. With the engine running at its designed output, the following should be measured to obtain the rated value and speed: .1 the rpm of the engine and the pump to obtain the rated speed; .2 the pressure at the suction and delivery side of the pump to obtain the rated water pressure.

It is recommended that this period should not exceed 15 s. 7.7.9 Where, in the opinion of the Administration, having regard to the particular voyages in which the ship carrying the boat is constantly engaged, a lower temperature is appropriate, that lower temperature should be substituted for -15°C in 7.7.8 for the cold start test. Engine-out-of-water test 7.7.10 The engine should be operated for at least 5 min at idling speed under conditions simulating normal storage. The engine should not be damaged as a result of this test. 8 LAUNCHING AND EMBARKATION APPLIANCES 8.1 Testing of davits and launching appliances 8.1.1 For lifeboats other than free-fall lifeboats, davits and launching appliances, except the winch brakes, should be subjected to a static proof load of 2.2 times their maximum working load. With the load at the full outboard position, the load should be swung through an arc of approximately 10° to each side of vertical in the intended fore and aft plane. The test should be done first in the upright position, followed by tests simulating a shipboard condition of list of 20° both inboard and outboard. There should be no evidence of significant deformation or other damage as a result of this test. For free-fall lifeboats, the launching appliances for lowering a free-fall lifeboat by falls, except the winch brakes, should be subjected to a static proof load of 2.2 times the maximum working load at the full outboard position. There should be no evidence of significant deformation or other damage as a result of this test. 8.1.2 For lifeboats other than free-fall lifeboats, a mass equal to 1.1 times the maximum working load should be suspended from the lifting points with the launching appliance in the upright position. The load should be moved from the full inboard to the full outboard position using the means of operation that is used on the ship. The test should be repeated with the launching appliance positioned to simulate a combined 20° inboard list and 10° trim. All the tests should be repeated with a mass equal to that of a fully equipped lifeboat, without persons, or the lightest survival craft intended for use with the davit to ensure the satisfactory functioning of the davit under very light load conditions. The appliance should successfully lower the load under all of the conditions, and there should be no evidence of significant deformation or other damage as a result of the tests. For freefall lifeboats, a mass equal to 1.1 times the maximum working load should be suspended from the lifting points. The load should be moved from the full inboard to the full outboard position using the means of operation that is to be used on the ship. The test should be repeated with a mass equal to that of the fully equipped lifeboat, without persons, to ensure the satisfactory functioning of the appliance under light load conditions. The appliance should successfully lower the load under both conditions and there should be no evidence of significant deformation or other damage as a result of the tests.

The load should be moved from the full inboard to the full outboard position using the means of operation that is used on the ship. The appliance should successfully move the maximum designed hoisting load from the outboard to the inboard position without causing permanent deformation or other damage. 8.1.4 Winch drums should be wound to the maximum number of turns permitted and a static test load of 1.5 times the maximum working load should be applied and held by the brake. This load should then be lowered for at least one complete revolution of the barrel shaft. A test load of 1.1 times the maximum working load should then be lowered at maximum lowering speed through a distance of at least 3 m and stopped by applying the hand brake sharply. For a lifeboat or rescue boat launching appliance, the test load should drop not more than 1 m when the brake is applied. For a fast rescue boat launching appliance, the test load should come to a rapid, but gradual stop, and the dynamical force induced in the wire should not exceed 0.5 times the working load of the launching appliance. This test should be repeated a number of times. If the winch design incorporates an exposed brake, one of these tests should be carried out with the brake wetted, but in this case the stopping distance may be exceeded. The various tests should achieve a cumulative lowering distance of at least 150 m. Operation of the winch with a load of a mass equal to that of a fully equipped lifeboat, without persons, or the lightest survival craft intended for use with the winch, should also be demonstrated. 8.1.5 It should be demonstrated that a winch intended for use with a rescue boat is capable of recovering the rescue boat with the number of persons for which it is to be approved and its equipment or an equivalent mass at a rate of not less than 0.3 m/s or 0.8 m/s in the case of a launching appliance for a fast rescue boat. 8.1.6 The hand operation of the winch should be demonstrated. If the winch is designed for quick recovery by hand with no load, this should be demonstrated with a load of 1.5 times the mass of the empty lifting arrangements. * 8.1.7 Following completion of the tests the winch should be stripped for inspection. These tests and the inspection should normally be witnessed by a representative of the Administration. 8.1.8 The fast rescue boat launching appliance should be demonstrated in a sea state associated with a force 6 wind on the Beaufort scale, in association with a significant wave height of at least 3 m. The test should include launching and recovery of a fast rescue boat and demonstrate: .1 satisfactory operation of the device to dampen forces and oscillations due to interaction with the waves; .2 satisfactory operation of the winch brake; and .3 satisfactory operation of the tensioning device.

MSC 70/23/Add.1 ANNEX 6 Page 69 I:\MSC\70\23A1.WPD Load test 8.2.5 The maximum load on the hook to allow for automatic release loads should be determined as follows: .1 the hook should be loaded with a mass of 200 kg and the actuating mechanism set; .2 the load should be reduced gradually in stages until the hook releases automatically, but at not more than 30 kg, to establish load F ; and .3 the load F should be measured and recorded. The minimum allowable load F is the minimum obtained at release which should be not less than 5 kg. 8.2.6 The hook should be loaded with a mass of 200 kg and the actuating mechanism set. The hook should then be subjected to cyclic loading between 30 kg and 200 kg using a frequency of 1 + 0.2 Hz. The hook should not release before 300 cycles. The number of cycles at which the hook opened or whether the test was discontinued at 300 cycles should be recorded. 8.2.7 The hook should then be reloaded to 200 kg and the actuating mechanism set. The hook should be subjected to a cyclic loading, the upper limit of which is +200 kg, and the lower limit being F 1 using a frequency of 1 + 0.2 Hz. The automatic release mechanism should operate within three cycles. The number of cycles at which the hook opened or whether the test was discontinued after three cycles should be recorded. F 1 is to be taken as the minimum load on the hook to allow for automatic release, as established in 8.2.5.2, reduced by 2 kg. 8.2.8 The hook should be attached to a short wire rope fall, approximately 1.5 m, and loaded with a mass of 10 kg. The weight should be secured and then lifted 1 m. From this position it should be released to perform a free fall before it is abruptly stopped by the wire rope fall. The hook should not release as a result of this test. 8.2.9 The automatic release hook should be attached to a test load equal to 1.1 times the safe working load, with the actuating mechanism in the locked position. The load should be raised to a height of at least 6 m and then be lowered at a speed of 0.6 m/s. When the load is 1.5 m above the ground or water surface, the actuating mechanism should be set for automatic release, and the lowering completed. The automatic release hook should release the load when it strikes the ground or water surface. The test should be repeated with a test load equal to 2.2 times the safe working load. 8.2.10 The automatic release hook should be attached to a test load of 1.1 times its maximum working load using an approved launching appliance. The test load should be lowered at maximum lowering speed through a distance of at least 3 m and stopped by applying the hand brake sharply. This test should be conducted twice, once with the release mechanism set for automatic release, and again with the mechanism set to closed. The release mechanism should not open in either test. 8.2.11 The hook should be loaded to 0, 25%, 50%, 75% and 100% of the safe working load of the hook. At each load level, the actuating force required at the actuating mechanism should be measured and recorded. The actuating force should be between 150 and 250 N if the hook is lanyard-operated, or the action required to set the actuating mechanism should be readily performed by a single person without difficulty.

Alternative designs should be demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Administration to provide adequate protection from inadvertent release under load. 8.2.14 The automatic release hook should be attached to a test load equal to the mass of the lightest liferaft for which the automatic release hook is to be approved, with the actuating mechanism in the locked position (i.e. not set for automatic release). The load should then be raised so that it is clear of the ground. The actuating mechanism should be set to automatic release. This should be easily accomplished by a single person and should not release the load. 8.2.15 The hook should be released 100 times without failure by each of its modes of release using the maximum load permitting release for that mode. It should then be disassembled and the parts examined. There should be no evidence of excessive wear on any part. 8.2.16 The hook should be arranged in a cold store at -30°C to simulate operational readiness and loaded with 25 kg. A 3.5 cm thick uniform layer of icing should be built onto it by spraying cold fresh water from angles above 45° from horizontal, with intermittent pauses to let icing form. The hook should then be actuated and as a result release the hold without failure. 8.2.17 It should be demonstrated that the hook is not damaged as a result of 10 impacts at a horizontal speed of 3.5 m/s on to a structure resembling a vertical ship's side. As far as practical all sides of the hook, especially areas with exposed controls, should impact the structure. The hook should not sustain any damage which will interfere with the normal function of the hook. Compatibility of liferaft and release hook 8.2.18 Where automatic release hooks are supplied for use with liferafts made by different manufacturers, operational tests with each type and size of lifting or attachment fitting used by the different manufacturers of the liferafts should be carried out before the particular combination of liferaft and release hook is accepted by the Administration. 9 LINE-THROWING APPLIANCES 9.1 Test for pyrotechnics Rockets used in line-throwing appliances should be subjected to the tests prescribed in 4.3.1, 4.3.3, 4.4, 4.5.1 (if appropriate), 4.5.5 and 4.5.6.

If the devices conform with the manufacturer's drawings and specifications, they should be accepted and assembled for further testing under the technical and performance tests as prescribed in 11.2 and 11.3. 11.2 Technical tests Each hydrostatic release unit should undergo all the following technical tests. No parts should be renewed or repaired between the tests. The tests should be conducted in the following sequence: .1 Corrosion resistance test A hydrostatic release unit should be exposed to a salt water spray test (5% natrium chloride solution) at a temperature of 35 ± 3°C for 160 h without interruption. After completion of the test the hydrostatic release unit should show no corrosion which could affect its efficient functioning and should then be subjected to the following tests after which it should continue to function efficiently. .2 Temperature test The hydrostatic release units should then be subjected to the temperature cycling prescribed in 1.2.1. Following temperature cycling as prescribed in 1.2.1, one hydrostatic release unit should be taken from a stowage temperature of -30°C and should then operate in seawater at a temperature of -1°C. The other hydrostatic release unit should be taken from a stowage temperature of +65°C, and should then operate in seawater at a temperature of +30°C. .3 Submergence and manual release tests The hydrostatic release unit should then be tested by applying a buoyant load equal to its designed capacity while the device is submerged in water or in a water-filled pressure testing tank. It should release at a depth of not more than 4 m. On completion of these tests and resetting, the hydrostatic release unit should be capable of being released manually if it is designed to allow manual release of the unit. It should then be opened for inspection and should show no significant signs of corrosion or degradation.

Personnel fabricating and packing inflatable liferafts should not be made aware of which liferaft will be tested until after the liferaft has been packed in its container. The painter should be pulled from the liferaft using a device to measure the applied force. The force required to pull the painter and start inflation should not exceed 150 N. The inflatable liferaft should break free from its container and attain its design shape and full erection of the canopy support tubes in not more than 1 min. 5.1.3 Each liferaft produced should be inspected for defects and dimensional deviations. 5.1.4 Each liferaft produced should be inflated with air to the lesser of 2.0 times its working pressure or that sufficient to impose a tensile load on the inflatable tube fabric of at least 20% of the minimum required tensile strength. Relief valves should be inoperative for this test. After 30 min the liferaft should not show any signs of seam slippage or rupture, nor should the pressure decrease by more than 5%. The measurement of the pressure drop due to leakage can be started when it has been assumed that the compartment rubber material has completed stretching due to the inflation pressure and stabilized. This test should be conducted after equilibrium condition has been achieved.

When the craft has reached its maximum lowering speed, the brake should be abruptly applied to demonstrate that the attachments of the davits and winches to the ship's structure are satisfactory. The maximum lowering speed established by the Administration should not be exceeded. 6.1.6 If lowering of the lifeboat is controlled from within the lifeboat by means of a control wire paid off from an auxiliary drum on the winch, the following additional points should receive particular consideration after installation of the davits and winches: .1 the mass on the control wire should be sufficient to overcome the friction of the various pulleys on the control wire, when turning out the lifeboat from the stowed to the embarkation position; .2 it should be possible to operate the winch brake from within the lifeboat; .3 the winch brake should not be affected by the mass of the fully extended control wire; .4 there should be sufficient length of control wire available at the lifeboat, during all stages of lowering; and .5 means should be provided to retain the free end of the control wire in the lifeboat until the lifeboat is detached from the launching appliance by the operator. 6.1.7 If the winch brake is exposed to the weather, the lowering test should be repeated with the braking surface wetted. Recovery test 6.1.8 It should be demonstrated that the davit-launched lifeboat or rescue boat can be recovered to its stowage position by means of operating the hand gear and can be safely and properly secured. 6.1.9 For free-fall lifeboats it should be demonstrated that the survival craft can be recovered to its stowage position and can be safely and properly secured. 6.1.10 Where davits are recovered by power, it should be demonstrated that the power is automatically cut off before the davit arms come against the stops. 6.1.11 In the case of rescue boat launching appliances, it should be demonstrated that the fully equipped rescue boat when loaded with a mass equal to that of the number of persons it is approved to carry can be recovered by means of a winch at a rate of no less than 0.3 m/s. 6.1.12 It should be demonstrated that the rescue boat can be recovered by means of the winch referred to in 6.1.11 using a hand gear.

MSC 70/23/Add.1 ANNEX 6 Page 92 I:\MSC\70\23A1.WPD Adjustable ramp test 6.1.13 It should be demonstrated that adjustable ramps for free-fall launching may be adjusted satisfactorily with the free-fall lifeboat loaded to 1.2 times its related load. 6.2 Installation tests of liferaft launching appliances Testing of release arrangements 6.2.1 When the hooks are made of cast steel, acceptable non-destructive tests should be carried out to establish that the material is free from surface or internal flaws. Static load test 6.2.2 Each release hook should be statically proof tested to 2.5 times the safe working load and be provided with an approved testing establishment certificate certifying that it has been so tested. Operational test 6.2.3 Each release hook should be submitted to an operational test with a mass equivalent to the safe working load being applied. The release arrangements should be demonstrated and checked with the liferaft loaded to ensure that the automatic release hook will not release while the load is still applied. Marking 6.2.4 Each release hook should be checked to ensure it is permanently marked with: .1 the manufacturer's name or the approved name of the release hook; .2 the date of manufacture; .3 the safe working load; .4 the number of the test certificate required by 6.2.2; and .5 clear, concise operating instructions. Lowering test 6.2.5 One liferaft ballasted to represent a 10% overload or an equivalent mass should be lowered from each launching appliance to establish the rate of lowering. The 10% overload should be 10% of the mass of the liferaft assembly together with its equipment and full complement of persons calculated at 75 kg per person. It should be jerked to ensure that the liferaft launching appliance, its fastenings and the supporting structures can withstand the associated loads. Recording of lowering test 6.2.6 The time should be recorded for the sequence of preparing, loading and launching three liferafts. If so desired, persons may be used only in the preparing and loading operations and ballast substituted for the lowering and launching part of the test. This sequence test need not be carried out on every launching RESOLUTION MSC.81(70) (adopted on 11 December 1998) REVISED RECOMMENDATION ON TESTING OF LIFE-SAVING APPLIANCES

MSC 70/23/Add.1 ANNEX 6 Page 93 I:\MSC\70\23A1.WPD appliance on a ship. However, at least one example of each launching appliance type and arrangement should be so tested on each ship. Towing strain test 6.2.7 A moderate towing strain should be put on the liferaft when waterborne to check that the release arrangements are satisfactory under this condition. 7 MARINE EVACUATION SYSTEMS 7.1 Installation tests 7.1.1 On the installation of a marine evacuation system on a ship, at least 50% of such systems should be subjected to a harbour trial deployment. At least one of these systems should be deployed in association with at least two of the inflatable liferafts to establish that correct launching and subsequent retrieving, bowsing-in and inflation procedures have been correctly installed. 7.1.2 Subject to the above deployments being satisfactory, untried systems should be similarly deployed within 12 months of the installation date. 7.1.3 For first of the above deployments, in association with the launching of the liferafts, a partial evacuation trial should be carried out to ensure that: .1 the system does not interfere with the launching of other life-saving equipment fitted on board; and .2 the system and associated liferafts are clear of all possible obstructions or dangers such as stabilisers or the ship's propellers. *** RESOLUTION MSC.81(70) (adopted on 11 December 1998) REVISED RECOMMENDATION ON TESTING OF LIFE-SAVING APPLIANCES
