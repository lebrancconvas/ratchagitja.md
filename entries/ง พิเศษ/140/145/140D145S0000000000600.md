MEPC 68/21/Add.1 Annex 10, page 5 https://edocs.imo.org/Final Documents/English/MEPC 68-21-ADD.1 (E).doc P REAMBLE 1 The International Code for Ships Operating in Polar Waters has been developed to supplement existing IMO instruments in order to increase the safety of ships' operation and mitigate the impact on the people and environment in the remote, vulnerable and potentially harsh polar waters. 2 The Code acknowledges that polar water operation may impose additional demands on ships, their systems and operation beyond the existing requirements of the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS), 1974, the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, 1973, as modified by the Protocol of 1978 relating thereto as amended by the 1997 Protocol, and other relevant binding IMO instruments. 3 The Code acknowledges that the polar waters impose additional navigational demands beyond those normally encountered. In many areas, the chart coverage may not currently be adequate for coastal navigation. It is recognized even existing charts may be subject to unsurveyed and uncharted shoals. 4 The Code also acknowledges that coastal communities in the Arctic could be, and that polar ecosystems are, vulnerable to human activities, such as ship operation. 5 The relationship between the additional safety measures and the protection of the environment is acknowledged as any safety measure taken to reduce the probability of an accident, will largely benefit the environment. 6 While Arctic and Antarctic waters have similarities, there are also significant differences. Hence, although the Code is intended to apply as a whole to both Arctic and Antarctic, the legal and geographical differences between the two areas have been taken into account. 7 The key principles for developing the Polar Code have been to use a risk-based approach in determining scope and to adopt a holistic approach in reducing identified risks. INTRODUCTION 1 Goal The goal of this Code is to provide for safe ship operation and the protection of the polar environment by addressing risks present in polar waters and not adequately mitigated by other instruments of the Organization. 2 Definitions For the purpose of this Code, the terms used have the meanings defined in the following paragraphs.

The ship's structural capacity to resist ice load and the ship's planned operations should be considered. The limitations should be incorporated into an ice operational decision support system. 1.2 Limitations for operating in ice should be determined using an appropriate methodology, such methodologies exist, have been in use for a number of years and have been validated with service experience. Existing methodologies and other systems may be acceptable to the Administration. 1.3 Operation in ice should take into account any operational limitations of the ship; extended information on the ice operational methodology contained in the PWOM; the condition of the ship and ship's systems, historical weather/ice data and weather/ice forecasts for the intended area of operation, current conditions including visual ice observations, sea state, visibility and the judgment of qualified personnel. 2 Operational assessment 2.1 This guidance is intended to support shipowners carrying out, and Administrations reviewing, the assessment required in part I-A, section 1.5, for operational limitations and procedures for the Polar Ship Certificate. 2.2 Steps for an operational assessment: .1 identify relevant hazards from section 3 of the Introduction and other hazards based on a review of the intended operations; .2 develop a model 16 to analyse risks considering: .1 development of accident scenarios; .2 probability of events in each accident scenario; and .3 consequence of end states in each scenario; .3 assess risks and determine acceptability: .1 estimate risk levels in accordance with the selected modelling approach; and .2 assess whether risk levels are acceptable; and 16 Reference is made to the techniques in appendix 3 of the Revised guidelines for Formal Safety Assessment (FSA) for use in the IMO Rule-Making Process (MSC-MEPC.2/Circ.12) and standard IEC/ISO 31010 " Risk management – Risk assessment techniques ".

MEPC 68/21/Add.1 Annex 10, page 31 https://edocs.imo.org/Final Documents/English/MEPC 68-21-ADD.1 (E).doc .4 in the event that risk levels determined in steps 1 to 3 are considered to be too high, identify current or develop new risk control options that aim to achieve one or more of the following: .1 reduce the frequency of failures through better design, procedures, training, etc.; .2 mitigate the effect of failures in order to prevent accidents; .3 limit the circumstances in which failures may occur; or .4 mitigate consequences of accidents; and .5 incorporate risk control options for design, procedures, training and limitations, as applicable. 3 Performance standards A system previously accepted based on manufacturer certifications, classification society certifications and/or satisfactory service of existing systems may be acceptable for installation on new and existing ships if no performance or testing standards are accepted by the Organization. 3 A DDITIONAL GUIDANCE TO CHAPTER 2 (P OLAR W ATER O PERATIONAL M ANUAL (PWOM)) 3.1 Recommendation on the content of the Polar Water Operational Manual The Polar Water Operational Manual (PWOM) is intended to address all aspects of operations addressed by chapter 2 of part I-A. When appropriate information, procedures or plans exist elsewhere in a ship's documentation, the PWOM itself does not need to replicate this material, but may instead cross-reference the relevant reference document. A model Table of Contents is found in appendix 2. The model follows the general structure of chapter 2. Not every section outlined below will be applicable to every polar ship. Many category C ships that undertake occasional or limit polar voyages will not need to have procedures for situations with a very low probability of occurrence. However, it may still be advisable to retain a common structure for the PWOM as a reminder that if assumptions change then the contents of the manual may also need to be updated. Noting an aspect as "not applicable" also indicates to the Administration that this aspect has been considered and not merely omitted. 3.2 Guidance on navigation with icebreaker assistance With respect to navigation with icebreaker assistance, the following should be considered: .1 while approaching the starting point of the ice convoy to follow an icebreaker/icebreakers or in the case of escorting by icebreaker of one ship to the point of meeting with the icebreaker, ships should establish radio communication on the VHF channel 16 and act in compliance with the icebreaker's instructions; .2 the icebreaker rendering the icebreaker assistance of ship ice convoy should command ships in the ice convoy;

MEPC 68/21/Add.1 Annex 10, page 32 https://edocs.imo.org/Final Documents/English/MEPC 68-21-ADD.1 (E).doc .3 position of a ship in the ice convoy should be determined by the icebreaker rendering the assistance; .4 ship within the ice convoy, in accordance with the instructions of the icebreaker rendering the assistance, should establish communication with the icebreaker by VHF channel indicated by the icebreaker; .5 the ship, while navigating in the ice convoy, should ensure compliance with the instructions of the icebreaker; .6 position in the ice convoy, speed and distance to a ship ahead should be as instructed by the icebreaker; .7 the ship should immediately notify the icebreaker of any difficulties to maintain the position within the ice convoy, speed and/or distance to any other ship in the ice convoy; and .8 the ship should immediately report to the icebreaker of any damage. 3.3 Guidance on the development of contingency plans In developing the ship's contingency plans ships should consider damage control measures arrangements for emergency transfer of liquids and access to tanks and spaces during salvage operations. See also additional guidance to chapter 9. 4 A DDITIONAL GUIDANCE TO CHAPTER 3 (S HIP STRUCTURE ) Method for determining equivalent ice class 1 The guidance presented below is intended to assist in determining equivalency with standards acceptable to the Organization, as referenced in chapters 3 and 6 of the Code. The methodology is consistent with guidance developed by the Organization 17 while allowing for the use of a simplified approach. 2 The basic approach for considering equivalency for categories A and B ships can be the same for both new and existing ships. It involves comparing other ice classes to the IACS Polar Classes. For ice classes under category C, additional information on comparisons of strengthening levels is available for the guidance of owners and Administrations. 18 The responsibility for generating the equivalency request and supporting information required should rest with the owner/operator. Review/approval of any equivalency request should be undertaken by the flag State Administration, or by a recognized organization acting on its behalf under the provisions of the Code for Recognized Organizations (RO Code). Several classification societies have developed easy-to-use tools for determination of compliance with the IACS Polar Class structural requirements, as have some Administrations and other third parties. 17 Refer to the G uidelines for the approval of alternatives and equivalents as provided for in various IMO instruments (MSC.1/Circ.1455). 18 Refer to the annex to HELCOM Recommendation 25/7, Safety of Winter Navigation in the Baltic Sea Area, available at www.helcom.fi

MEPC 68/21/Add.1 Annex 10, page 33 https://edocs.imo.org/Final Documents/English/MEPC 68-21-ADD.1 (E).doc 3 The scope of a simplified equivalency assessment (referring to paragraphs 6.1 to 6.3 below) is expected to be limited to materials selection, structural strength of the hull and propulsion machinery. 4 If there is not full and direct compliance, then an equivalent level of risk can be accepted in accordance with guidance provided by the Organization. An increase in the probability of an event can be balanced by a reduction in its consequences. Alternatively, a reduction in probability could potentially allow acceptance of more serious consequences. Using a hull area example, a local shortfall in strength level or material grade could be accepted if the internal compartment is a void space, for which local damage will not put the overall safety of the ship at risk or lead to any release of pollutants. 5 For existing ships, service experience can assist in risk assessment. As an example, for an existing ship with a record of polar ice operations a shortfall in the extent of the ice belt (hull areas) may be acceptable if there is no record of damage to the deficient area; i.e. a ship that would generally meet PC 5 requirements but in limited areas is only PC 7 could still be considered as a category A, PC 5 ship. In all such cases, the ship's documentation should make clear the nature and scope of any deficiencies. 6 The process includes the following stages of assessment: .1 select the target Polar Class for equivalency; .2 compare materials used in the design with minimum requirements under the IACS Polar Class URs; identify any shortfalls; and .3 compare strength levels of hull and machinery components design with requirements under the IACS Polar Class URs; quantify levels of compliance. 7 Where gaps in compliance are identified in steps 1 to 3, additional steps should be necessary to demonstrate equivalency, as outlined below: .4 identify any risk mitigation measures incorporated in the design of the ship (over and above the requirements of the Code and IACS URs); .5 where applicable, provide documentation of service experience of existing ships, in conditions relevant to the target ice class for equivalency; and .6 undertake an assessment, taking into account information from steps 1 to 5, as applicable, and on the principles outlined in paragraphs 2 to 6 above. 8 Documentation provided with an application for equivalency should identify each stage that has been undertaken, and sufficient supporting information to validate assessments. 9 Where a ship in categories A or B is provided with an equivalency for ice class by its flag State, this should be noted in its Polar Ship Certificate. 5 A DDITIONAL GUIDANCE TO CHAPTER 4 ( SUBDIVISION AND S TABILITY ) No additional guidance 6 A DDITIONAL GUIDANCE TO CHAPTER 5 (W ATERTIGHT AND WEATHERTIGHT INTEGRITY ) No additional guidance.

For example, and when operating on the continental shelf: .1 the echo-sounder should be working and monitored to detect any sign of unexpected depth variation, especially when the chart is not based on a full search of the sea floor; and .2 independent cross-checking of positioning information (e.g. visual and radar fixing and GNSS) should be undertaken at every opportunity. Mariners should ensure to report to the relevant charting authority (Hydrographic Office) any information that might contribute to improving the nautical charts and publications.

MEPC 68/21/Add.1 Annex 10, page 36 https://edocs.imo.org/Final Documents/English/MEPC 68-21-ADD.1 (E).doc 10.4 Ships should be fitted with: .1 a suitable means to de-ice sufficient conning position windows to provide unimpaired forward and astern vision from conning positions; and .2 an efficient means of clearing melted ice, freezing rain, snow, mist and spray from outside and accumulated condensation from inside. A mechanical means to clear moisture from the outside face of a window should have operating mechanisms protected from freezing or the accumulation of ice that would impair effective operation. 11 A DDITIONAL GUIDANCE TO CHAPTER 10 (C OMMUNICATION ) 11.1 Limitations of communication systems in high latitude 11.1.1 Current maritime digital communication systems were not designed to cover Polar waters. 11.1.2 VHF is still largely used for communication at sea, but only over short distances (line of sight) and normally only for voice communication. HF and MF are also used for emergency situations. Digital VHF, mobile phone systems and other types of wireless technology offer enough digital capacity for many maritime applications, but only to ships within sight of shore-based stations, and are, therefore, not generally available in polar waters. AIS could also be used for low data-rate communication, but there are very few base stations, and the satellite-based AIS system is designed for data reception only. 11.1.3 The theoretical limit of coverage for GEO systems is 81.3° north or south, but instability and signal dropouts can occur at latitudes as low as 70° north or south under certain conditions. Many factors influence the quality of service offered by GEO systems, and they have different effects depending on the system design. 11.1.4 Non-GMDSS systems may be available and may be effective for communication in polar waters. 11.2 Advice for the operation of multiple alerting and communication devices in the event of an incident A procedure should be developed to ensure that when survival craft are in close proximity, not more than two alerting or locating devices are activated (as required by regulation 10.3.2) at the same time. This is to: .1 preserve battery life; .2 enable extended periods of time for the transmission of alerting or locating signals; and .3 avoid potential interference. 11.3 For satellite distress beacons, although multiple beacon transmissions can be detected successfully by the satellite system, it is not recommended to activate multiple beacons, unless the survival craft operating the beacons are widely dispersed, as this can cause interference on direction-finding equipment.

An appropriate decision support system, such as the Canada's Arctic Ice Regime Shipping System, and/or the Russian Ice Certificate as described in the Rules of Navigation on the water area of the Northern Sea Route, can be used... Bridge personnel should be trained in the proper use of the system to be utilized. For ships that will operate only in ice-free waters, procedures to ensure that will keep the ship from encountering ice should be established. 1.2 Icebreaking capabilities Guidance: The PWOM should provide information on the ice conditions in which the ship can be expected to make continuous progress. This may be drawn, for example from numerical analysis, model test or from ice trials. Information on the influence of ice strength for new or decayed ice and of snow cover may be included. 1.3 Manoeuvring in ice 1.4 Special features Guidance: Where applicable, the PWOM should include the results of any equivalency analyses made to determine Polar Ship category/ice class. The manual should also provide information on the use of any specialized systems fitted to assist in ice operations. Chapter 2 Operation in low air temperatures 2.1 System design Guidance : The PWOM should list all ship systems susceptible to damage or loss of functionality by exposure to low temperatures, and the measures to be adopted to avoid malfunction. Chapter 3 Communication and navigation capabilities in high latitudes Guidance: The PWOM should identify any restrictions to operational effectiveness of communications and navigational equipment that may result from operating in high latitudes. Chapter 4 Voyage duration Guidance: The PWOM should provide information on any limitations on ship endurance such as fuel tankage, fresh water capacity, provision stores, etc. This will normally only be a significant consideration for smaller ships, or for ships planning to spend extended periods in ice.

MEPC 68/21/Add.1 Annex 10, page 52 https://edocs.imo.org/Final Documents/English/MEPC 68-21-ADD.1 (E).doc Division 2 – Ship operations Chapter 1 Strategic planning Assumptions used in conducting the analyses referred to below should be included in the Manual. 1.1 Avoidance of hazardous ice Guidance: For ships operating frequently in polar waters, the PWOM should provide information with respect to periods during which the ship should be able to operate for intended areas of operation. Areas that pose particular problems, e.g. chokepoints, ridging, as well as worst recorded ice conditions should be noted. Where the available information is limited or of uncertain quality, this should be recognized and noted as a risk for voyage planning. 1.2 Avoidance of hazardous temperatures Guidance: For ships operating frequently in polar waters, the PWOM should provide information with respect to, the daily mean daily low temperature as well as the minimum recorded temperature for each of the days during the intended operating period. Where the available information is limited or of uncertain quality, this should be recognized as a risk for voyage planning. 1.3 Voyage duration and endurance Guidance: Procedures to establish requirements for supplies should be established, and appropriate safety levels for safety margins determined taking into account various scenarios, e.g. slower than expected steaming, course alterations, adverse ice conditions, places of refuge and access to provisions. Sources for and availability of fuel types should be established, taking into account long lead times required for deliveries. 1.4 Human resources management Guidance: The PWOM should provide guidance for the human resources management, taking into account the anticipated ice conditions and requirements for ice navigation, increased levels of watch keeping, hours of rest, fatigue and a process that ensures that these requirements will be met. Chapter 2 Arrangements for receiving forecasts of environmental conditions Guidance: The PWOM should set out the means and frequency for provision of ice and weather information. Where a ship is intended to operate in or in the presence of ice, the manual should set out when weather and ice information is required and the format for the information. When available, the information should include both global and localized forecasts that will identify weather and ice patterns/regimes that could expose the ship to adverse conditions. The frequency of updates should provide enough advance notice that the ship can take refuge or use other methods of avoiding the hazard if the conditions are forecast to exceed its capabilities.

MEPC 68/21/Add.1 Annex 10, page 53 https://edocs.imo.org/Final Documents/English/MEPC 68-21-ADD.1 (E).doc The PWOM may include use of a land-based support information provider an effective method of sorting through available information, thereby providing the ship only with information that is relevant, reducing demands on the ship's communications systems. The manual may also indicate instances in which additional images should be obtained and analysed, as well as where such additional information may be obtained. 2.1 Ice information Guidance: The PWOM should include or refer to guidance on how radar should be used to identify ice floes, how to tune the radar to be most effective, instructions on how to interpret radar images, etc. If other technologies are to be used to provide ice information, their use should also be described. 2.2 Meteorological information Chapter 3 Verification of hydrographic, meteorological and navigational information Guidance: The PWOM should provide guidance on the use of hydrographic information as further described in the additional guidance to chapter 10. Chapter 4 Operation of Special Equipment 4.1 Navigation systems 4.2 Communications systems Chapter 5 Procedures to maintain equipment and system functionality 5.1 Icing prevention and de-icing Guidance: The PWOM should provide guidance on how to prevent or mitigate icing by operational means, how to monitor and assess ice accretion, how to conduct de-icing using equipment available on the ship, and how to maintain the safety of the ship and its crew during all of these aspects of the operation. 5.2 Operation of seawater systems Guidance: The PWOM should provide guidance on how to monitor, prevent or mitigate ice ingestion by seawater systems when operating in ice or in low water temperatures. This may include recirculation, use of low rather than high suctions, etc. 5.3 Procedures for low temperature operations Guidance: The PWOM should provide guidance on maintaining and monitoring any systems and equipment that are required to be kept active in order to ensure functionality; e.g. by trace heating or continuous working fluid circulation.

MEPC 68/21/Add.1 Annex 10, page 54 https://edocs.imo.org/Final Documents/English/MEPC 68-21-ADD.1 (E).doc Division 3 – Risk management Chapter 1 Risk mitigation in limiting environmental condition 1.1 Measures to be considered in adverse ice conditions Guidance: The PWOM should contain guidance for the use of low speeds in the presence of hazardous ice. Procedures should also be set for enhanced watchkeeping and lookout manning in situations with high risks from ice, e.g. in proximity to icebergs, operation at night, and other situations of low visibility. When possibilities for contact with hazardous ice exist, procedures should address regular monitoring, e.g. soundings/inspections of compartments and tanks below the waterline. 1.2 Measures to be considered in adverse temperature conditions Guidance: The PWOM should contain guidance on operational restrictions in the event that temperatures below the ships polar service temperature are encountered or forecast.
