SOLAS/CONF.5/34 I:\CONF\SOLAS\5\34.DOC ANNEX 1 CONFERENCE RESOLUTION 2 (adopted on 12 December 2002) ADOPTION OF THE INTERNATIONAL CODE FOR THE SECURITY OF SHIPS AND OF PORT FACILITIES THE CONFERENCE, HAVING ADOPTED amendments to the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea, 1974, as amended (hereinafter referred to as ìthe Conventionî), concerning special measures to enhance maritime safety and security, CONSIDERING that the new chapter XI-2 of the Convention makes a reference to an International Ship and Port Facility Security (ISPS) Code and requires that ships, companies and port facilities to comply with the relevant requirements of part A of the International Ship and Port Facility Security (ISPS) Code, as specified in part A of the ISPS Code, BEING OF THE OPINION that the implementation by Contracting Governments of the said chapter will greatly contribute to the enhancement of maritime safety and security and safeguarding those on board and ashore, HAVING CONSIDERED a draft of the International Code for the Security of Ships and of Port Facilities prepared by the Maritime Safety Committee of the International Maritime Organization (hereinafter referred to as ìthe Organizationî), at its seventy-fifth and seventy-sixth session, for consideration and adoption by the Conference, 1. ADOPTS the International Code for the Security of Ships and of Port Facilities (hereinafter referred to as ìthe Codeî), the text of which is set out in the Annex to the present resolution; 2. INVITES Contracting Governments to the Convention to note that the Code will take effect on 1 July 2004 upon entry into force of the new chapter XI-2 of the Convention; 3.

SOLAS/CONF.5/34 ANNEX 1 Page 2 I:\CONF\SOLAS\5\34.DOC ANNEX INTERNATIONAL CODE FOR THE SECURITY OF SHIPS AND OF PORT FACILITIES PREAMBLE 1 The Diplomatic Conference on Maritime Security held in London in December 2002 adopted new provisions in the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea, 1974 and this Code * to enhance maritime security. These new requirements form the international framework through which ships and port facilities can co-operate to detect and deter acts which threaten security in the maritime transport sector. 2 Following the tragic events of 11th September 2001, the twenty-second session of the Assembly of the International Maritime Organization (the Organization), in November 2001, unanimously agreed to the development of new measures relating to the security of ships and of port facilities for adoption by a Conference of Contracting Governments to the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea, 1974 (known as the Diplomatic Conference on Maritime Security) in December 2002. Preparation for the Diplomatic Conference was entrusted to the Organizationís Maritime Safety Committee (MSC) on the basis of submissions made by Member States, intergovernmental organizations and non-governmental organizations in consultative status with the Organization. 3 The MSC, at its first extraordinary session, held also in November 2001, in order to accelerate the development and the adoption of the appropriate security measures established an MSC Intersessional Working Group on Maritime Security . The first meeting of the MSC Intersessional Working Group on Maritime Security was held in February 2002 and the outcome of its discussions was reported to, and considered by, the seventy-fifth session of the MSC in March 2002, when an ad hoc Working Group was established to further develop the proposals made. The seventy-fifth session of the MSC considered the report of that Working Group and recommended that work should be taken forward through a further MSC Intersessional Working Group, which was held in September 2002. The seventy-sixth session of the MSC considered the outcome of the September 2002 session of the MSC Intersessional Working Group and the further work undertaken by the MSC Working Group held in conjunction with the Committee's seventy-sixth session in December 2002, immediately prior to the Diplomatic Conference and agreed the final version of the proposed texts to be considered by the Diplomatic Conference. 4 The Diplomatic Conference (9 to 13 December 2002) also adopted amendments to the existing provisions of the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea, 1974 (SOLAS 74) accelerating the implementation of the requirement to fit Automatic Identification Systems and adopted new Regulations in Chapter XI-1 of SOLAS 74 covering marking of the Shipís Identification Number and the carriage of a Continuous Synopsis Record. The Diplomatic Conference also adopted a number of Conference Resolutions including those covering implementation and revision of this Code, Technical Co-operation, and co-operative work with the International Labour Organization and World Customs Organization. It was recognized that * The complete name of this Code is the International Code for the Security of Ships and of Port Facilities. The abbreviated name of this Code, as referred to in regulation XI-2/1 of SOLAS 74 as amended, is the International Ship and Port Facility Security (ISPS) Code or, in short, the ISPS Code.

SOLAS/CONF.5/34 ANNEX 1 Page 3 I:\CONF\SOLAS\5\34.DOC review and amendment of certain of the new provisions regarding maritime security may be required on completion of the work of these two Organizations. 5 The provision of Chapter XI-2 of SOLAS 74 and this Code apply to ships and to port facilities. The extension of SOLAS 74 to cover port facilities was agreed on the basis that SOLAS 74 offered the speediest means of ensuring the necessary security measures entered into force and given effect quickly. However, it was further agreed that the provisions relating to port facilities should relate solely to the ship/port interface. The wider issue of the security of port areas will be the subject of further joint work between the International Maritime Organization and the International Labour Organization. It was also agreed that the provisions should not extend to the actual response to attacks or to any necessary clear-up activities after such an attack. 6 In drafting the provision care has been taken to ensure compatibility with the provisions of the International Convention on Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping and Certification for Seafarers, 1978, as amended, the International Safety Management (ISM) Code and the harmonised system of survey and certification. 7 The provisions represent a significant change in the approach of the international maritime industries to the issue of security in the maritime transport sector. It is recognized that they may place a significant additional burden on certain Contracting Governments. The importance of Technical Co-operation to assist Contracting Governments implement the provisions is fully recognized. 8 Implementation of the provisions will require continuing effective co-operation and understanding between all those involved with, or using, ships and port facilities including shipís personnel, port personnel, passengers, cargo interests, ship and port management and those in National and Local Authorities with security responsibilities. Existing practices and procedures will have to be reviewed and changed if they do not provide an adequate level of security. In the interests of enhanced maritime security additional responsibilities will have to be carried by the shipping and port industries and by National and Local Authorities. 9 The guidance given in part B of this Code should be taken into account when implementing the security provisions set out in Chapter XI-2 of SOLAS 74 and in part A of this Code. However, it is recognized that the extent to which the guidance applies may vary depending on the nature of the port facility and of the ship, its trade and/or cargo. 10 Nothing in this Code shall be interpreted or applied in a manner inconsistent with the proper respect of fundamental rights and freedoms as set out in international instruments, particularly those relating to maritime workers and refugees including the International Labour Organization Declaration of Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work as well as international standards concerning maritime and port workers. 11 Recognizing that the Convention on the Facilitation of Maritime Traffic, 1965, as amended, provides that foreign crew members shall be allowed ashore by the public authorities while the ship on which they arrive is in port, provided that the formalities on arrival of the ship have been fulfilled and the public authorities have no reason to refuse permission to come ashore for reasons of public health, public safety or public order, Contracting Governments when approving ship and port facility security plans should pay due cognisance to the fact that ship's personnel live and work on the vessel and need shore leave and access to shore based seafarer welfare facilities, including medical care.

SOLAS/CONF.5/34 ANNEX 1 Page 21 I:\CONF\SOLAS\5\34.DOC 19 V ERIFICATION AND CERTIFICATION FOR SHIPS 19.1 Verifications 19.1.1 Each ship to which this Part of the Code applies shall be subject to the verifications specified below: .1 an initial verification before the ship is put in service or before the certificate required under section 19.2 is issued for the first time, which shall include a complete verification of its security system and any associated security equipment covered by the relevant provisions of chapter XI-2, this Part of the Code and the approved ship security plan. This verification shall ensure that the security system and any associated security equipment of the ship fully complies with the applicable requirements of chapter XI-2 and this Part of the Code, is in satisfactory condition and fit for the service for which the ship is intended; .2 a renewal verification at intervals specified by the Administration, but not exceeding five years, except where section 19.3 is applicable. This verification shall ensure that the security system and any associated security equipment of the ship fully complies with the applicable requirements of chapter XI-2, this Part of the Code and the approved ship security plan, is in satisfactory condition and fit for the service for which the ship is intended; .3 at least one intermediate verification. If only one intermediate verification is carried out it shall take place between the second and third anniversary date of the certificate as defined in regulation I/2(n). The intermediate verification shall include inspection of the security system and any associated security equipment of the ship to ensure that it remains satisfactory for the service for which the ship is intended. Such intermediate verification shall be endorsed on the certificate; .4 any additional verifications as determined by the Administration. 19.1.2 The verifications of ships shall be carried out by officers of the Administration. The Administration may, however, entrust the verifications to a recognized security organization referred to in regulation XI-2/1. 19.1.3 In every case, the Administration concerned shall fully guarantee the completeness and efficiency of the verification and shall undertake to ensure the necessary arrangements to satisfy this obligation. 19.1.4 The security system and any associated security equipment of the ship after verification shall be maintained to conform with the provisions of regulations XI-2/4.2 and XI-2/6, this Part of the Code and the approved ship security plan. After any verification under section 19.1.1 has been completed, no changes shall be made in security system and in any associated security equipment or the approved ship security plan without the sanction of the Administration. 19.2 Issue or endorsement of certificate 19.2.1 An International Ship Security Certificate shall be issued after the initial or renewal verification in accordance with the provisions of section 19.1.

SOLAS/CONF.5/34 ANNEX 1 Page 22 I:\CONF\SOLAS\5\34.DOC 19.2.2 Such certificate shall be issued or endorsed either by the Administration or by a recognized security organization acting on behalf of the Administration. 19.2.3 Another Contracting Government may, at the request of the Administration, cause the ship to be verified and, if satisfied that the provisions of section 19.1.1 are complied with, shall issue or authorize the issue of an International Ship Security Certificate to the ship and, where appropriate, endorse or authorize the endorsement of that certificate on the ship, in accordance with this Code. 19.2.3.1 A copy of the certificate and a copy of the verification report shall be transmitted as soon as possible to the requesting Administration. 19.2.3.2 A certificate so issued shall contain a statement to the effect that it has been issued at the request of the Administration and it shall have the same force and receive the same recognition as the certificate issued under section 19.2.2. 19.2.4 The International Ship Security Certificate shall be drawn up in a form corresponding to the model given in the appendix to this Code. If the language used is not English, French or Spanish, the text shall include a translation into one of these languages. 19.3 Duration and validity of certificate 19.3.1 An International Ship Security Certificate shall be issued for a period specified by the Administration which shall not exceed five years. 19.3.2 When the renewal verification is completed within three months before the expiry date of the existing certificate, the new certificate shall be valid from the date of completion of the renewal verification to a date not exceeding five years from the date of expiry of the existing certificate. 19.3.2.1 When the renewal verification is completed after the expiry date of the existing certificate, the new certificate shall be valid from the date of completion of the renewal verification to a date not exceeding five years from the date of expiry of the existing certificate. 19.3.2.2 When the renewal verification is completed more than three months before the expiry date of the existing certificate, the new certificate shall be valid from the date of completion of the renewal verification to a date not exceeding five years from the date of completion of the renewal verification. 19.3.3 If a certificate is issued for a period of less than five years, the Administration may extend the validity of the certificate beyond the expiry date to the maximum period specified in section 19.3.1, provided that the verifications referred to in section 19.1.1 applicable when a certificate is issued for a period of five years are carried out as appropriate. 19.3.4 If a renewal verification has been completed and a new certificate cannot be issued or placed on board the ship before the expiry date of the existing certificate, the Administration or recognized security organization acting on behalf of the Administration may endorse the existing certificate and such a certificate shall be accepted as valid for a further period which shall not exceed five months from the expiry date.

SOLAS/CONF.5/34 ANNEX 1 Page 23 I:\CONF\SOLAS\5\34.DOC 19.3.5 If a ship at the time when a certificate expires is not in a port in which it is to be verified, the Administration may extend the period of validity of the certificate but this extension shall be granted only for the purpose of allowing the ship to complete its voyage to the port in which it is to be verified, and then only in cases where it appears proper and reasonable to do so. No certificate shall be extended for a period longer than three months, and the ship to which an extension is granted shall not, on its arrival in the port in which it is to be verified, be entitled by virtue of such extension to leave that port without having a new certificate. When the renewal verification is completed, the new certificate shall be valid to a date not exceeding five years from the expiry date of the existing certificate before the extension was granted. 19.3.6 A certificate issued to a ship engaged on short voyages which has not been extended under the foregoing provisions of this section may be extended by the Administration for a period of grace of up to one month from the date of expiry stated on it. When the renewal verification is completed, the new certificate shall be valid to a date not exceeding five years from the date of expiry of the existing certificate before the extension was granted. 19.3.7 If an intermediate verification is completed before the period specified in section 19.1.1, then: .1 the expiry date shown on the certificate shall be amended by endorsement to a date which shall not be more than three years later than the date on which the intermediate verification was completed; .2 the expiry date may remain unchanged provided one or more additional verifications are carried out so that the maximum intervals between the verifications prescribed by section 19.1.1 are not exceeded. 19.3.8 A certificate issued under section 19.2 shall cease to be valid in any of the following cases: .1 if the relevant verifications are not completed within the periods specified under section 19.1.1; .2 if the certificate is not endorsed in accordance with section 19.1.1.3 and 19.3.7.1, if applicable; .3 when a Company assumes the responsibility for the operation of a ship not previously operated by that Company; and .4 upon transfer of the ship to the flag of another State. 19.3.9 In the case of: .1 a transfer of a ship to the flag of another Contracting Government, the Contracting Government whose flag the ship was formerly entitled to fly shall, as soon as possible, transmit to the receiving Administration copies of, or all information relating to, the International Ship Security Certificate carried by the ship before the transfer and copies of available verification reports, or .2 a Company that assumes responsibility for the operation of a ship not previously operated by that Company, the previous Company shall as soon as possible,

SOLAS/CONF.5/34 ANNEX 1 Page 24 I:\CONF\SOLAS\5\34.DOC transmit to the receiving Company copies of any information related to the International Ship Security Certificate or to facilitate the verifications described in section 19.4.2. 19.4 Interim certification 19.4.1 The certificates specified in section 19.2 shall be issued only when the Administration issuing the certificate is fully satisfied that the ship complies with the requirements of section 19.1. However, after 1 July 2004, for the purposes of: .1 a ship without a certificate, on delivery or prior to its entry or re-entry into service; .2 transfer of a ship from the flag of a Contracting Government to the flag of another Contracting Government; .3 transfer of a ship to the flag of a Contracting Government from a State which is not a Contracting Government; or .4 when a Company assumes the responsibility for the operation of a ship not previously operated by that Company; until the certificate referred to in section 19.2 is issued, the Administration may cause an Interim International Ship Security Certificate to be issued, in a form corresponding to the model given in the Appendix to this Part of the Code. 19.4.2 An Interim International Ship Security Certificate shall only be issued when the Administration or recognized security organization, on behalf of the Administration, has verified that: .1 the ship security assessment required by this Part of the Code has been completed, .2 a copy of the ship security plan meeting the requirements of chapter XI-2 and part A of this Code is provided on board, has been submitted for review and approval, and is being implemented on the ship; .3 the ship is provided with a ship security alert system meeting the requirements of regulation XI-2/6, if required, .4 the company security officer: .1 has ensured: .1 the review of the ship security plan for compliance with this Part of the Code, .2 that the plan has been submitted for approval, and .3 that the plan is being implemented on the ship, and

SOLAS/CONF.5/34 ANNEX 1 Page 25 I:\CONF\SOLAS\5\34.DOC .2 has established the necessary arrangements, including arrangements for drills, exercises and internal audits, through which the company security officer is satisfied that the ship will successfully complete the required verification in accordance with section 19.1.1.1, within 6 months; .5 arrangements have been made for carrying out the required verifications under section 19.1.1.1; .6 the master, the shipís security officer and other shipís personnel with specific security duties are familiar with their duties and responsibilities as specified in this Part of the Code; and with the relevant provisions of the ship security plan placed on board; and have been provided such information in the working language of the shipís personnel or languages understood by them; and .7 the ship security officer meets the requirements of this Part of the Code. 19.4.3 An Interim International Ship Security Certificate may be issued by the Administration or by a recognized security organization authorized to act on its behalf. 19.4.4 An Interim International Ship Security Certificate shall be valid for 6 months, or until the certificate required by section 19.2 is issued, whichever comes first, and may not be extended. 19.4.5 No Contracting Government shall cause a subsequent, consecutive Interim International Ship Security Certificate to be issued to a ship if, in the judgment of the Administration or the recognized security organization, one of the purposes of the ship or a Company in requesting such certificate is to avoid full compliance with chapter XI-2 and this Part of the Code beyond the period of the initial interim certificate as specified in section 19.4.4. 19.4.6 For the purposes of regulation XI-2/9, Contracting Governments may, prior to accepting an Interim International Ship Security Certificate as a valid certificate, ensure that the requirements of sections 19.4.2.4 to 19.4.2.6 have been met.

SOLAS/CONF.5/34 ANNEX 1 Page 31 I:\CONF\SOLAS\5\34.DOC P ART B G UIDANCE REGARDING THE PROVISIONS OF C HAPTER XI-2 OF THE A NNEX TO THE I NTERNATIONAL C ONVENTION FOR THE S AFETY OF L IFE AT S EA , 1974 AS AMENDED AND P ART A OF THIS C ODE 1 I NTRODUCTION General 1.1 The preamble of this Code indicates that chapter XI-2 and part A of this Code establish the new international framework of measures to enhance maritime security and through which ships and port facilities can co-operate to detect and deter acts which threaten security in the maritime transport sector. 1.2 This introduction outlines, in a concise manner, the processes envisaged in establishing and implementing the measures and arrangements needed to achieve and maintain compliance with the provisions of chapter XI-2 and of part A of this Code and identifies the main elements on which guidance is offered. The guidance is provided in paragraphs 2 through to 19. It also sets down essential considerations, which should be taken into account when considering the application of the guidance relating to ships and port facilities. 1.3 If the readerís interest relates to ships alone, it is strongly recommended that this Part of the Code is still read as a whole, particularly the sections relating to port facilities. The same applies to those whose primary interest are port facilities; they should also read the sections relating to ships. 1.4 The guidance provided in the following sections relates primarily to protection of the ship when it is at a port facility. There could, however, be situations when a ship may pose a threat to the port facility, e.g. because, once within the port facility, it could be used as a base from which to launch an attack. When considering the appropriate security measures to respond to ship-based security threats, those completing the Port Facility Security Assessment or preparing the Port Facility Security Plan should consider making appropriate adaptations to the guidance offered in the following sections. 1.5 The reader is advised that nothing in this Part of the Code should be read or interpreted in conflict with any of the provisions of either chapter XI-2 or part A of this Code and that the aforesaid provisions always prevail and override any unintended inconsistency which may have been inadvertently expressed in this Part of the Code. The guidance provided in this Part of the Code should always be read, interpreted and applied in a manner which is consistent with the aims, objectives and principles established in chapter XI-2 and part A of this Code. Responsibilities of Contracting Governments 1.6 Contracting Governments have, under the provisions of chapter XI-2 and part A of this Code, various responsibilities, which, amongst others, include: - setting the applicable security level;

SOLAS/CONF.5/34 ANNEX 1 Page 32 I:\CONF\SOLAS\5\34.DOC - approving the Ship Security Plan and relevant amendments to a previously approved plan; - verifying the compliance of ships with the provisions of chapter XI-2 and part A of this Code and issuing to ships the International Ship Security Certificate; - determining which of the port facilities located within their territory are required to designate a Port Facility Security Officer who will be responsible for the preparation of the Port Facility Security Plan; - ensuring completion and approval of the Port Facility Security Assessment and of any subsequent amendments to a previously approved assessment; - approving the Port Facility Security Plan and any subsequent amendments to a previously approved plan; and - exercising control and compliance measures; - testing approved plans; and - communicating information to the International Maritime Organization and to the shipping and port industries. 1.7 Contracting Governments can designate, or establish, Designated Authorities within Government to undertake, with respect to port facilities, their security duties under chapter XI-2 and part A of this Code and allow Recognized Security Organizations to carry out certain work with respect to port facilities but the final decision on the acceptance and approval of this work should be given by the Contracting Government or the Designated Authority. Administrations may also delegate the undertaking of certain security duties , relating to ships, to Recognized Security Organizations. The following duties or activities cannot be delegated to a Recognized Security Organization: - setting of the applicable security level; - determining which of the port facilities located within the territory of a Contracting Government are required to designate a Port Facility Security Officer and to prepare a Port Facility Security Plan; - approving a Port Facility Security Assessment or any subsequent amendments to a previously approved assessment; - approving a Port Facility Security Plan or any subsequent amendments to a previously approved plan; - exercising control and compliance measures; and - establishing the requirements for a Declaration of Security. Setting the security level 1.8 The setting of the security level applying at any particular time is the responsibility of Contracting Governments and can apply to ships and port facilities. Part A of this Code defines three security levels for international use. These are:

SOLAS/CONF.5/34 ANNEX 1 Page 33 I:\CONF\SOLAS\5\34.DOC - Security Level 1, normal; the level at which ships and port facilities normally operate; - Security Level 2, heightened; the level applying for as long as there is a heightened risk of a security incident; and - Security Level 3, exceptional, the level applying for the period of time when there is the probable or imminent risk of a security incident. The Company and the Ship 1.9 Any Company operating ships to which chapter XI-2 and part A of this Code apply has to designate a Company Security Officer for the Company and a Ship Security Officer for each of its ships. The duties, responsibilities and training requirements of these officers and requirements for drills and exercises are defined in part A of this Code. 1.10 The Company Security Officerís responsibilities include, in brief amongst others, ensuring that a Ship Security Assessment is properly carried out, that a Ship Security Plan is prepared and submitted for approval by, or on behalf of, the Administration and thereafter is placed on board each ship to which part A of this Code applies and in respect of which that person has been appointed as the Company Security Officer. 1.11 The Ship Security Plan should indicate the operational and physical security measures the ship itself should take to ensure it always operates at security level 1. The plan should also indicate the additional, or intensified, security measures the ship itself can take to move to and operate at security level 2 when instructed to do so. Furthermore, the plan should indicate the possible preparatory actions the ship could take to allow prompt response to the instructions that may be issued to the ship by those responding at security level 3 to a security incident or threat thereof. 1.12 The ships to which the requirements of chapter XI-2 and part A of this Code apply are required to have, and operated in accordance with, a Ship Security Plan approved by, or on behalf of, the Administration. The Company and Ship Security Officer should monitor the continuing relevance and effectiveness of the plan, including the undertaking of internal audits. Amendments to any of the elements of an approved plan , for which the Administration has determined that approval is required, have to be submitted for review and approval before their incorporation in the approved plan and their implementation by the ship. 1.13 The ship has to carry an International Ship Security Certificate indicating that it complies with the requirements of chapter XI-2 and part A of this Code. Part A of this Code includes provisions relating to the verification and certification of the shipís compliance with the requirements on an initial, renewal and intermediate verification basis. 1.14 When a ship is at a port or is proceeding to a port of a Contracting Government, the Contracting Government has the right, under the provisions of regulation XI-2/9, to exercise various control and compliance measures with respect to that ship. The ship is subject to port State control inspections but such inspections will not normally extend to examination of the Ship Security Plan itself except in specific circumstances. The ship may, also, be subject to additional control measures if the Contracting Government exercising the control and compliance

SOLAS/CONF.5/34 ANNEX 1 Page 34 I:\CONF\SOLAS\5\34.DOC measures has reason to believe that the security of the ship has, or the port facilities it has served have, been compromised. 1.15 The ship is also required to have onboard information, to be made available to Contracting Governments upon request, indicating who is responsible for deciding the employment of the shipís personnel and for deciding various aspects relating to the employment of the ship. The port facility 1.16 Each Contracting Government has to ensure completion of a Port Facility Security Assessment for each of the port facilities , located within its territory, serving ships engaged on international voyages. The Contracting Government, a Designated Authority or a Recognized Security Organization may carry out this assessment. The completed Port Facility Security Assessment has to be approved by the Contracting Government or the Designated Authority concerned. This approval cannot be delegated. Port Facility Security Assessments should be periodically reviewed. 1.17 The Port Facility Security Assessment is fundamentally a risk analysis of all aspects of a port facilityís operation in order to determine which part(s) of it are more susceptible, and/or more likely, to be the subject of attack. Security risk is a function of the threat of an attack coupled with the vulnerability of the target and the consequences of an attack. The assessment must include the following components: - the perceived threat to port installations and infrastructure must be determined; - the potential vulnerabilities identified; and - the consequences of incidents calculated. On completion of the analysis, it will be possible to produce an overall assessment of the level of risk. The Port Facility Security Assessment will help determine which port facilities are required to appoint a Port Facility Security Officer and prepare a Port Facility Security Plan. 1.18 The port facilities which have to comply with the requirements of chapter XI-2 and part A of this Code are required to designate a Port Facility Security Officer. The duties, responsibilities and training requirements of these officers and requirements for drills and exercises are defined in part A of this Code. 1.19 The Port Facility Security Plan should indicate the operational and physical security measures the port facility should take to ensure that it always operates at security level 1. The plan should also indicate the additional, or intensified, security measures the port facility can take to move to and operate at security level 2 when instructed to do so. Furthermore, the plan should indicate the possible preparatory actions the port facility could take to allow prompt response to the instructions that may be issued by those responding at security level 3 to a security incident or threat thereof. 1.20 The port facilities which have to comply with the requirements of chapter XI-2 and part A of this Code are required to have , and operate in accordance with, a Port Facility Security Plan approved by the Contracting Government or by the Designated Authority concerned. The Port

SOLAS/CONF.5/34 ANNEX 1 Page 35 I:\CONF\SOLAS\5\34.DOC Facility Security Officer should implement its provisions and monitor the continuing effectiveness and relevance of the plan, including commissioning internal audits of the application of the plan. Amendments to any of the elements of an approved plan, for which the Contracting Government or the Designated Authority concerned has determined that approval is required, have to be submitted for review and approval before their incorporation in the approved plan and their implementation at the port facility. The Contracting Government or the Designated Authority concerned may test the effectiveness of the plan. The Port Facility Security Assessment covering the port facility or on which the development of the plan has been based should be regularly reviewed. All these activities may lead to amendment of the approved plan. Any amendments to specified elements of an approved plan will have to be submitted for approval by the Contracting Government or by the Designated Authority concerned. 1.21 Ships using port facilities may be subject to the port State control inspections and additional control measures outlined in regulation XI-2/9. The relevant authorities may request the provision of information regarding the ship, its cargo, passengers and shipís personnel prior to the shipís entry into port. There may be circumstances in which entry into port could be denied. Information and communication 1.22 Chapter XI-2 and part A of this Code require Contracting Governments to provide certain information to the International Maritime Organization and for information to be made available to allow effective communication between Contracting Governments and between Company/Ship Security Officers and the Port Facility Security Officers. 2 D EFINITIONS 2.1 No guidance is provided with respect to the definitions set out in chapter XI-2 or part A of this Code. 2.2 For the purpose of this Part of the Code: .1 ì section î means a section of part A of the Code and is indicated as ì section A/< followed by the number of the section >î; .2 ì paragraph î means a paragraph of this Part of the Code and is indicated as ì paragraph < followed by the number of the paragraph >î; and .3 ìContracting Governmentî, when used in paragraphs 14 to 18, means the ìContracting Government within whose territory the port facility is locatedî and includes a reference to the ìDesignated Authorityî. 3 A PPLICATION General 3.1 The guidance given in this Part of the Code should be taken into account when implementing the requirements of chapter XI-2 and part A of this Code.

SOLAS/CONF.5/34 ANNEX 1 Page 36 I:\CONF\SOLAS\5\34.DOC 3.2 However, it should be recognized that the extent to which the guidance on ships applies will depend on the type of ship, its cargoes and/or passengers, its trading pattern and the characteristics of the port facilities visited by the ship. 3.3 Similarly, in relation to the guidance on port facilities, the extent to which this guidance applies will depend on the port facilities, the types of ships using the port facility, the types of cargo and/or passengers and the trading patterns of visiting ships. 3.4 The provisions of chapter XI-2 and part A of this Code are not intended to apply to port facilities designed and used primarily for military purposes. 4 R ESPONSIBILITIES OF C ONTRACTING G OVERNMENTS Security of assessments and plans 4.1 Contracting Governments should ensure that appropriate measures are in place to avoid unauthorized disclosure of, or access to, security sensitive material relating to Ship Security Assessments, Ship Security Plans, Port Facility Security Assessments and Port Facility Security Plans, and to individual assessments or plans. Designated authorities 4.2 Contracting Governments may identify a Designated Authority within Government to undertake their security duties relating to port facilities as set out in chapter XI-2 or part A of this Code. Recognized Security Organizations 4.3 Contracting Governments may authorize a Recognized Security Organization (RSO) to undertake certain security related activities, including: .1 approval of Ship Security Plans, or amendments thereto, on behalf of the Administration; .2 verification and certification of compliance of ships with the requirements of chapter XI-2 and part A of this Code on behalf of the Administration; and .3 conducting Port Facility Security Assessments required by the Contracting Government. 4.4 An RSO may also advise or provide assistance to Companies or port facilities on security matters, including Ship Security Assessments, Ship Security Plans, Port Facility Security Assessments and Port Facility Security Plans. This can include completion of a Ship Security Assessment or Plan or Port Facility Security Assessment or Plan. If an RSO has done so in respect of a ship security assessment or plan that RSO should not be authorized to approve that ship security plan. 4.5 When authorizing an RSO, Contracting Governments should give consideration to the competency of such an organization. An RSO should be able to demonstrate: .1 expertise in relevant aspects of security;

SOLAS/CONF.5/34 ANNEX 1 Page 37 I:\CONF\SOLAS\5\34.DOC .2 appropriate knowledge of ship and port operations, including knowledge of ship design and construction if providing services in respect of ships and port design and construction if providing services in respect of port facilities; .3 their capability to assess the likely security risks that could occur during ship and port facility operations including the ship/port interface and how to minimise such risks; .4 their ability to maintain and improve the expertise of their personnel; .5 their ability to monitor the continuing trustworthiness of their personnel; .6 their ability to maintain appropriate measures to avoid unauthorized disclosure of, or access to, security sensitive material; .7 their knowledge of the requirements chapter XI-2 and part A of this Code and relevant national and international legislation and security requirements; .8 their knowledge of current security threats and patterns; .9 their knowledge on recognition and detection of weapons, dangerous substances and devices; .10 their knowledge on recognition, on a non-discriminatory basis, of characteristics and behavioural patterns of persons who are likely to threaten security; .11 their knowledge on techniques used to circumvent security measures; and .12 their knowledge of security and surveillance equipment and systems and their operational limitations. When delegating specific duties to a RSO, Contracting Governments, including Administrations, should ensure that the RSO has the competencies needed to undertake the task. 4.6 A Recognized Organization, as defined in regulation I/6 and fulfilling the requirements of regulation XI-1/1, may be appointed as a RSO provided it has the appropriate security related expertise listed in paragraph 4.5. 4.7 A Port or Harbour Authority or Port Facility operator may be appointed as a RSO provided it has the appropriate security related expertise listed in paragraph 4.5. Setting the security level 4.8 In setting the security level Contracting Governments should take account of general and specific threat information. Contracting Governments should set the security level applying to ships or port facilities at one of three levels: - Security level 1: normal, the level at which the ship or port facility normally operates; - Security level 2: heightened, the level applying for as long as there is a heightened risk of a security incident; and

SOLAS/CONF.5/34 ANNEX 1 Page 38 I:\CONF\SOLAS\5\34.DOC - Security level 3: exceptional, the level applying for the period of time when there is the probable or imminent risk of a security incident. 4.9 Setting security level 3 should be an exceptional measure applying only when there is credible information that a security incident is probable or imminent. Security level 3 should only be set for the duration of the identified security threat or actual security incident. While the security levels may change from security level 1, through security level 2 to security level 3, it is also possible that the security levels will change directly from security level 1 to security level 3. 4.10 At all times the Master of a ship has the ultimate responsibility for the safety and security of the ship. Even at security level 3 a Master may seek clarification or amendment of instructions issued by those responding to a security incident, or threat thereof, if there are reasons to believe that compliance with any instruction may imperil the safety of the ship. 4.11 The Company Security Officer (CSO) or the Ship Security Officer (SSO) should liase at the earliest opportunity with the Port Facility Security Officer (PFSO) of the port facility the ship is intended to visit to establish the security level applying for that ship at the port facility. Having established contact with a ship, the PFSO should advise the ship of any subsequent change in the port facilityís security level and should provide the ship with any relevant security information. 4.12 While there may be circumstances when an individual ship may be operating at a higher security level than the port facility it is visiting, there will be no circumstances when a ship can have a lower security level than the port facility it is visiting. If a ship has a higher security level than the port facility it intends to use, the CSO or SSO should advise the PFSO without delay. The PFSO should undertake an assessment of the particular situation in consultation with the CSO or SSO and agree on appropriate security measures with the ship, which may include completion and signing of a Declaration of Security. 4.13 Contracting Governments should consider how information on changes in security levels should be promulgated rapidly. Administrations may wish to use NAVTEX messages or Notices to Mariners as the method for notifying such changes in security levels to ship and CSO and SSO. Or, they may wish to consider other methods of communication that provide equivalent or better speed and coverage. Contracting Governments should establish means of notifying PFSOs of changes in security levels. Contracting Governments should compile and maintain the contact details for a list of those who need to be informed of changes in security levels. Whereas the security level need not be regarded as being particularly sensitive, the underlying threat information may be highly sensitive. Contracting Governments should give careful consideration to the type and detail of the information conveyed and the method by which it is conveyed, to SSOs, CSOs and PFSOs. Contact points and information on Port Facility Security Plans 4.14 Where a port facility has a PFSP, that fact has to be communicated to the Organization and that information must also be made available to Company and Ship Security Officers. No further details of the PFSP have to be published other than that it is in place. Contracting Governments should consider establishing either central or regional points of contact, or other means of providing up to date information on the locations where PFSPs are in place, together with contact details for the relevant PFSO. The existence of such contact points should be publicised. They could also provide information on the recognized security organizations

SOLAS/CONF.5/34 ANNEX 1 Page 39 I:\CONF\SOLAS\5\34.DOC appointed to act on behalf of the Contracting Government, together with details of the specific responsibility and conditions of authority delegated to such recognized security organizations. 4.15 In the case of a port that does not have a PFSP (and therefore does not have a PFSO) the central or regional point of contact should be able to identify a suitably qualified person ashore who can arrange for appropriate security measures to be in place, if needed, for the duration of the shipís visit. 4.16 Contracting Governments should also provide the contact details of Government officers to whom an SSO, a CSO and a PFSO can report security concerns. These Government officers should assess such reports before taking appropriate action. Such reported concerns may have a bearing on the security measures falling under the jurisdiction of another Contracting Government. In that case, the Contracting Governments should consider contacting their counterpart in the other Contracting Government to discuss whether remedial action is appropriate. For this purpose, the contact details of the Government officers should be communicated to the International Maritime Organization. 4.17 Contracting Governments should also make the information indicated in paragraphs 4.14 to 4.16, available to other Contracting Governments on request. Identification documents 4.18 Contracting Governments are encouraged to issue appropriate identification documents to Government officials entitled to board ships or enter port facilities when performing their official duties and to establish procedures whereby the authenticity of such documents might be verified. Fixed and floating platforms and mobile offshore drilling units on location 4.19 Contracting Governments should consider establishing appropriate security measures for fixed and floating platforms and mobile offshore drilling units on location to allow interaction with ships which are required to comply with the provisions of chapter XI-2 and part A of this Code 1 . Ships which are not required to comply with part A of this Code 4.20 Contracting Governments should consider establishing appropriate security measures to enhance the security of ships to which this chapter XI-2 and part A of this Code does not apply and to ensure that any security provisions applying to such ships allow interaction with ships to which part A of this Code applies. Threats to ships and other incidents at sea 4.21 Contracting Governments should provide general guidance on the measures considered appropriate to reduce the security risk to ships flying their flag when at sea. They should provide specific advice on the action to be taken in accordance with security levels 1 to 3, if: 1 Refer to Establishment of appropriate measures to enhance the security of ships, port facilities, mobile offshore drilling units on location and fixed and floating platforms not covered by chapter XI-2 of 1974 SOLAS Convention, adopted by the Conference on Maritime Security by resolution 7.

SOLAS/CONF.5/34 ANNEX 1 Page 40 I:\CONF\SOLAS\5\34.DOC .1 there is a change in the security level applying to the ship while it is at sea, e.g. because of the geographical area in which it is operating or relating to the ship itself; and .2 there is a security incident or threat thereof involving the ship while at sea. Contracting Governments should establish the best methods and procedures for these purposes. In the case of an imminent attack the ship should seek to establish direct communication with those responsible in the flag State for responding to security incidents. 4.22 Contracting Governments should also establish a point of contact for advice on security for any ship: .1 entitled to fly their flag; or .2 operating in their territorial sea or having communicated an intention to enter their territorial sea. 4.23 Contracting Governments should offer advice to ships operating in their territorial sea or having communicated an intention to enter their territorial sea, which could include advice: .1 to alter or delay their intended passage; .2 to navigate on a particular course or proceed to a specific location; .3 on the availability of any personnel or equipment that could be placed on the ship; .4 to co-ordinate the passage, arrival into port or departure from port, to allow escort by patrol craft or aircraft (fixed-wing or helicopter). Contracting Governments should remind ships operating in their territorial sea, or having communicated an intention to enter their territorial sea, of any temporary restricted areas that they have published. 4.24 Contracting Governments should recommend that ships operating in their territorial sea, or having communicated an intention to enter their territorial sea, implement expeditiously, for the shipís protection and for the protection of other ships in the vicinity, any security measure the Contracting Government may have advised. 4.25 The plans prepared by the Contracting Governments for the purposes given in paragraph 4.22 should include information on an appropriate point of contact, available on a 24- hour basis, within the Contracting Government including the Administration. These plans should also include information on the circumstances in which the Administration considers assistance should be sought from nearby coastal States, and a procedure for liaison between port facility security officers and ship security officers. Alternative security agreements 4.26 Contracting Governments, in considering how to implement chapter XI-2 and part A of this Code, may conclude one or more agreements with one or more Contracting Governments. The scope of an agreement is limited to short international voyages on fixed routes between port

SOLAS/CONF.5/34 ANNEX 1 Page 41 I:\CONF\SOLAS\5\34.DOC facilities in the territory of the parties to the agreement. When concluding an agreement, and thereafter, the Contracting Governments should consult other Contracting Governments and Administrations with an interest in the effects of the agreement. Ships flying the flag of a State that is not party to the agreement should only be allowed to operate on the fixed routes covered by the agreement if their Administration agrees that the ship should comply with the provisions of the agreement and requires the ship to do so. In no case can such an agreement compromise the level of security of other ships and port facilities not covered by it, and specifically, all ships covered by such an agreement may not conduct ship-to-ship activities with ships not so covered. Any operational interface undertaken by ships covered by the agreement should be covered by it. The operation of each agreement must be continually monitored and amended when the need arises and in any event should be reviewed every 5 years. Equivalent arrangements for port facilities 4.27 For certain specific port facilities with limited or special operations but with more than occasional traffic, it may be appropriate to ensure compliance by security measures equivalent to those prescribed in chapter XI-2 and in part A of this Code. This can, in particular, be the case for terminals such as those attached to factories, or quaysides with no frequent operations. Manning level 4.28 In establishing the minimum safe manning of a ship the Administration should take into account 2 that the minimum safe manning provisions established by regulation V/14 3 only address the safe navigation of the ship. The Administration should also take into account any additional workload which may result from the implementation of the shipís security plan and ensure that the ship is sufficiently and effectively manned. In doing so the Administration should verify that ships are able to implement the hours of rest and other measures to address fatigue which have been promulgated by national law, in the context of all shipboard duties assigned to the various shipboard personnel. Control and compliance measures 4 General 4.29 Regulation XI-2/9 describes the control and compliance measures applicable to ships under chapter XI-2. It is divided into three distinct sections; control of ships already in a port, control of ships intending to enter a port of another Contracting Government, and additional provisions applicable to both situations. 4.30 Regulation XI-2/9.1, control of ships in port, implements a system for the control of ships while in the port of a foreign country where duly authorized officers of the Contracting Government (duly authorized officers) have the right to go on board the ship to verify that the required certificates are in proper order. Then if there are clear grounds to believe the ship does 2 Refer to Further Work by the International Maritime Organization pertaining to Enhancement of Maritime Security, adopted by the Conference on Maritime Security by resolution 3, inviting, amongst others, the Organization to review Assembly Resolution A.890(21) on Principles of Safe Manning. This review may also lead to amendments of regulation V/14. 3 As was in force on the date of adoption of this Code. 4 Refer to Further Work by the International Maritime Organization pertaining to Enhancement of Maritime Security, adopted by the Conference on Maritime Security by resolution 3, inviting, amongst others, the Organization to review Assembly Resolutions A.787(19) and A.882(21) on Procedures for Port State Control.

SOLAS/CONF.5/34 ANNEX 1 Page 42 I:\CONF\SOLAS\5\34.DOC not comply, control measures such as additional inspections or detention may be taken. This reflects current control systems 5 . Regulation XI-2/9.1 builds on such systems and allows for additional measures (including expulsion of a ship from a port to be taken as a control measure) when duly authorized officers have clear grounds for believing that a ship is in non-compliance with the requirements of chapter XI-2 or part A of this Code. Regulation XI-2/9.3 describes the safeguards that promote fair and proportionate implementation of these additional measures. 4.31 Regulation XI-2/9.2 applies control measures to ensure compliance to ships intending to enter a port of another Contracting Government and introduces an entirely different concept of control within chapter XI-2, applying to security only. Under this regulation measures may be implemented prior to the ship entering port, to better ensure security. Just as in regulation XI-2/9.1, this additional control system is based on the concept of clear grounds for believing the ship does not comply with chapter XI-2 or part A of this Code, and includes significant safeguards in regulations XI-2/9.2.2 and XI-2/9.2.5 as well as in regulation XI-2/9.3. 4.32 Clear grounds that the ship is not in compliance means evidence or reliable information that the ship does not correspond with the requirements of chapter XI-2 or part A of this Code, taking into account the guidance given in this Part of the Code. Such evidence or reliable information may arise from the duly authorized officerís professional judgement or observations gained while verifying the shipís International Ship Security Certificate or Interim International Ship Security Certificate issued in accordance with part A of this Code (certificate) or from other sources. Even if a valid certificate is on board the ship, the duly authorized officers may still have clear grounds for believing that the ship is not in compliance based on their professional judgment. 4.33 Examples of possible clear grounds under regulations XI-2/9.1 and XI-2/9.2 may include, when relevant: .1 evidence from a review of the certificate that it is not valid or it has expired; .2 evidence or reliable information that serious deficiencies exist in the security equipment, documentation or arrangements required by chapter XI-2 and part A of this Code; .3 receipt of a report or complaint which, in the professional judgment of the duly authorized officer, contains reliable information clearly indicating that the ship does not comply with the requirements of chapter XI-2 or part A of this Code; .4 evidence or observation gained by a duly authorized officer using professional judgment that the master or shipís personnel is not familiar with essential shipboard security procedures or cannot carry out drills related to the security of the ship or that such procedures or drills have not been carried out; .5 evidence or observation gained by a duly authorized officer using professional judgment that key members shipís personnel are not able to establish proper communication with any other key members of shipís personnel with security responsibilities on board the ship; 5 See regulation I/19 and regulation IX/6.2 of SOLAS 74 as amended, article 21 of LOADLINE 66 as modified by the 1988 LOADLINE Protocol, articles 5 and 6, regulation 8A of Annex I, regulation 15 of Annex II of MARPOL 73/78 as amended, article X of STCW 78 as amended and IMO Assembly Resolutions A.787(19) and A.882(21).

SOLAS/CONF.5/34 ANNEX 1 Page 43 I:\CONF\SOLAS\5\34.DOC .6 evidence or reliable information that the ship has embarked persons, or loaded stores or goods at a port facility or from another ship where either the port facility or the other ship is in violation of chapter XI-2 or part A of this Code, and the ship in question has not completed a Declaration of Security, nor taken appropriate, special or additional security measures or has not maintained appropriate ship security procedures; .7 evidence or reliable information that the ship has embarked persons, or loaded stores or goods at a port facility or from another source (e.g., another ship or helicopter transfer) where either the port facility or the other source is not required to comply with chapter XI-2 or part A of this Code, and the ship has not taken appropriate, special or additional security measures or has not maintained appropriate security procedures; and .8 if the ship holds a subsequent, consecutively issued Interim International Ship Security Certificate as described in section A/19.4, and if, in the professional judgment of an officer duly authorized, one of the purposes of the ship or a Company in requesting such a certificate is to avoid full compliance with chapter XI-2 and part A of this Code beyond the period of the initial interim certificate as described in section A/19.4.4. 4.34 The international law implications of regulation XI-2/9 are particularly relevant, and the regulation should be implemented with regulation XI-2/2.4 in mind, as the potential exists for situations where either measures will be taken which fall outside the scope of chapter XI-2, or where rights of affected ships, outside chapter XI-2, should be considered. Thus, regulation XI-2/9 does not prejudice the Contracting Government from taking measures having a basis in, and consistent with, international law, to ensure the safety or security of persons, ships, port facilities and other property in cases where the ship, although in compliance with chapter XI-2 and part A of this Code, is still considered to present a security risk. 4.35 When a Contracting Government imposes control measures on a ship, the Administration should, without delay, be contacted with sufficient information to enable the Administration to fully liaise with the Contracting Government. Control of ships in port 4.36 Where the non-compliance is either a defective item of equipment or faulty documentation leading to the shipís detention and the non-compliance cannot be remedied in the port of inspection, the Contracting Government may allow the ship to sail to another port provided that any conditions agreed between the port States and the Administration or master are met. Ships intending to enter the port of another Contracting Government 4.37 Regulation XI-2/9.2.1 lists the information Contracting Governments may require from a ship as a condition of entry into port. One item of information listed is confirmation of any special or additional measures taken by the ship during its last ten calls at a port facility. Examples could include:

SOLAS/CONF.5/34 ANNEX 1 Page 44 I:\CONF\SOLAS\5\34.DOC .1 records of the measures taken while visiting a port facility located in the territory of a State which is not a Contracting Government especially those measures that would normally have been provided by port facilities located in the territories of Contracting Governments; and .2 any Declarations of Security that were entered into with port facilities or other ships. 4.38 Another item of information listed, that may be required as a condition of entry into port, is confirmation that appropriate ship security procedures were maintained during ship-to-ship activity conducted within the period of the last 10 calls at a port facility. It would not normally be required to include records of transfers of pilots, customs, immigration, security officials nor bunkering, lightering, loading of supplies and unloading of waste by ship within port facilities as these would normally fall within the auspices of the Port Facility Security Plan. Examples of information that might be given include: .1 records of the measures taken while engaged in a ship to ship activity with a ship flying the flag of a State which is not a Contracting Government especially those measures that would normally have been provided by ships flying the flag of Contracting Governments; .2 records of the measures taken while engaged in a ship to ship activity with a ship that is flying the flag of a Contracting Government but is not required to comply with the provisions of chapter XI-2 and part A of this Code such as a copy of any security certificate issued to that ship under other provisions; and .3 in the event that persons or goods rescued at sea are on board, all known information about such persons or goods, including their identities when known and the results of any checks run on behalf of the ship to establish the security status of those rescued. It is not the intention of chapter XI-2 or part A of this Code to delay or prevent the delivery of those in distress at sea to a place of safety. It is the sole intention of chapter XI-2 and part A of this Code to provide States with enough appropriate information to maintain their security integrity. 4.39 Examples of other practical security related information that may be required as a condition of entry into port in order to assist with ensuring the safety and security of persons, port facilities, ships and other property include: .1 information contained in the Continuous Synopsis Record; .2 location of the ship at the time the report is made; .3 expected time of arrival of the ship in port; .4 crew list; .5 general description of cargo aboard the ship; .6 passenger list; and .7 information required to be carried under regulation XI-2/5.

SOLAS/CONF.5/34 ANNEX 1 Page 45 I:\CONF\SOLAS\5\34.DOC 4.40 Regulation XI-2/9.2.5 allows the master of a ship, upon being informed that the coastal or port State will implement control measures under regulation XI-2/9.2, to withdraw the intention for the ship to enter port. If the master withdraws that intention, regulation XI-2/9 no longer applies, and any other steps that are taken must be based on, and consistent with, international law. Additional provisions 4.41 In all cases where a ship is denied entry or expelled from a port, all known facts should be communicated to the authorities of relevant States. This communication should consist of the following when known: .1 name of ship, its flag, the shipís identification number, call sign, ship type and cargo; .2 reason for denying entry or expulsion from port or port areas; .3 if relevant, the nature of any security non-compliance; .4 if relevant, details of any attempts made to rectify any non-compliance, including any conditions imposed on the ship for the voyage; .5 past port(s) of call and next declared port of call; .6 time of departure and likely estimated time of arrival at those ports; .7 any instructions given to ship, e.g., reporting on route; .8 available information on the security level at which the ship is currently operating; .9 information regarding any communications the port State has had with the Administration; .10 contact point within the port State making the report for the purpose of obtaining further information; .11 crew list; and .12 any other relevant information. 4.42 Relevant States to contact should include those along the shipís intended passage to its next port, particularly if the ship intends to enter the territorial sea of that coastal State. Other relevant States could include previous ports of call, so that further information might be obtained and security issues relating to the previous ports resolved. 4.43 In exercising control and compliance measures, the duly authorized officers should ensure that any measures or steps imposed are proportionate. Such measures or steps should be reasonable and of the minimum severity and duration necessary to rectify or mitigate the non- compliance.

SOLAS/CONF.5/34 ANNEX 1 Page 46 I:\CONF\SOLAS\5\34.DOC 4.44 The word ìdelayî in regulation XI-2/9.3.5.1 also refers to situations where, pursuant to actions taken under this regulation, the ship is unduly denied entry into port or the ship is unduly expelled from port. Non-party ships and ships below convention size 4.45 With respect to ships flying the flag of a State which is not a Contracting Government to the Convention and not a Party to the 1988 SOLAS Protocol 6 , Contracting Governments should not give more favourable treatment to such ships. Accordingly, the requirements of regulation XI-2/9 and the guidance provided in this Part of the Code should be applied to those ships. 4.46 Ships below Convention size are subject to measures by which States maintain security. Such measures should be taken with due regard to the requirements in chapter XI-2 and the guidance provided in this Part of the Code. 5 D ECLARATION OF S ECURITY General 5.1 A Declaration of Security (DoS) should be completed when the Contracting Government of the port facility deems it to be necessary or when a ship deems it necessary. 5.1.1 The need for a DoS may be indicated by the results of the Port Facility Security Assessment (PFSA) and the reasons and circumstances in which a DoS is required should be set out in the Port Facility Security Plan (PFSP). 5.1.2 The need for a DoS may be indicated by an Administration for ships entitled to fly its flag or as a result of a ship security assessment and should be set out in the ship security plan. 5.2 It is likely that a DoS will be requested at higher security levels, when a ship has a higher security level than the port facility, or another ship with which it interfaces, and for ship/port interface or ship to ship activities that pose a higher risk to persons, property or the environment for reasons specific to that ship, including its cargo or passengers or the circumstances at the port facility or a combination of these factors. 5.2.1 In the case that a ship or an Administration, on behalf of ships entitled to fly its flag, requests completion of a DoS, the Port Facility Security Officer (PFSO) or Ship Security Officer (SSO) should acknowledge the request and discuss appropriate security measures. 5.3 A PFSO may also initiate a DoS prior to ship/port interfaces that are identified in the approved PFSA as being of particular concern. Examples may include the embarking or disembarking passengers, and the transfer, loading or unloading of dangerous goods or hazardous substances. The PFSA may also identify facilities at or near highly populated areas or economically significant operations that warrant a DoS. 5.4 The main purpose of a DoS is to ensure agreement is reached between the ship and the port facility or with other ships with which it interfaces as to the respective security measures each will undertake in accordance with the provisions of their respective approved security plans. 6 Protocol of 1988 relating to the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea, 1974.

SOLAS/CONF.5/34 ANNEX 1 Page 47 I:\CONF\SOLAS\5\34.DOC 5.4.1 The agreed DoS should be signed and dated by both the port facility and the ship(s), as applicable, to indicate compliance with chapter XI-2 and part A of this Code and should include its duration, the relevant security level, or levels and the relevant contact details. 5.4.2 A change in the security level may require that a new or revised DoS be completed. 5.5 The DoS should be completed in English, French or Spanish or in a language common to both the port facility and the ship or the ships, as applicable. 5.6 A model DoS is included in Appendix 1 to this Part of the Code. This model is for a DoS between a ship and a port facility. If the DoS is to cover two ships this model should be appropriately adjusted. 6 O BLIGATIONS OF THE C OMPANY General 6.1 Regulation XI-2/5 requires the company to provide the master of the ship with information to meet the requirements of the Company under the provisions of this regulation. This information should include items such as: .1 parties responsible for appointing shipboard personnel, such as ship management companies, manning agents, contractors, concessionaries (for example, retail sales outlets, casinos, etc.); .2 parties responsible for deciding the employment of the ship including, time or bareboat charterer(s) or any other entity acting in such capacity; and .3 in cases when the ship is employed under the terms of a charter party, the contact details of those parties including time or voyage charterers. 6.2 In accordance with regulation XI-2/5 the Company is obliged to update and keep this information current as and when changes occur. 6.3 This information should be in English, French or Spanish language. 6.4 With respect to ships constructed before 1 July 2004, this information should reflect the actual condition on that date. 6.5 With respect to ships constructed on or after 1 July 2004 and for ships constructed before 1 July 2004 which were out of service on 1 July 2004, the information should be provided as from the date of entry of the ship into service and should reflect the actual condition on that date. 6.6 After 1 July 2004 when a ship is withdrawn from service the information should be provided as from the date of re-entry of the ship into service and should reflect the actual condition on that date. 6.7 Previously provided information that does not relate to the actual condition on that date need not be retained on board.

SOLAS/CONF.5/34 ANNEX 1 Page 48 I:\CONF\SOLAS\5\34.DOC 6.8 When the responsibility for the operation of the ship is assumed by another Company, the information relating to the Company, which operated the ship, is not required to be left on board. In addition other relevant guidance is provided under sections 8, 9 and 13. 7 S HIP S ECURITY Relevant guidance is provided under sections 8, 9 and 13. 8 S HIP S ECURITY A SSESSMENT Security assessment 8.1 The Company Security Officer (CSO) is responsible for ensuring that a Ship Security Assessment (SSA) is carried out for each of the ships in the Companyís fleet which is required to comply with the provisions of chapter XI-2 and part A of this Code for which the CSO is responsible. While the CSO need not necessarily personally undertake all the duties associated with the post, the ultimate responsibility for ensuring that they are properly performed remains with the individual CSO. 8.2 Prior to commencing the SSA, the CSO should ensure that advantage is taken of information available on the assessment of threat for the ports at which the ship will call or at which passengers embark or disembark and about the port facilities and their protective measures. The CSO should study previous reports on similar security needs. Where feasible, the CSO should meet with appropriate persons on the ship and in the port facilities to discuss the purpose and methodology of the assessment. The CSO should follow any specific guidance offered by the Contracting Governments. 8.3 A SSA should address the following elements on board or within the ship: .1 physical security; .2 structural integrity; .3 personnel protection systems; .4 procedural policies; .5 radio and telecommunication systems, including computer systems and networks; and .6 other areas that may, if damaged or used for illicit observation, pose a risk to persons, property, or operations on board the ship or within a port facility. 8.4 Those involved in a SSA should be able to draw upon expert assistance in relation to: .1 knowledge of current security threats and patterns; .2 recognition and detection of weapons, dangerous substances and devices; .3 recognition, on a non-discriminatory basis, of characteristics and behavioural patterns of persons who are likely to threaten security;

SOLAS/CONF.5/34 ANNEX 1 Page 49 I:\CONF\SOLAS\5\34.DOC .4 techniques used to circumvent security measures; .5 methods used to cause a security incident; .6 effects of explosives on shipís structures and equipment; .7 ship security; .8 ship/port interface business practices; .9 contingency planning, emergency preparedness and response; .10 physical security; .11 radio and telecommunications systems, including computer systems and networks; .12 marine engineering; and .13 ship and port operations. 8.5 The CSO should obtain and record the information required to conduct an assessment, including: .1 the general layout of the ship; .2 the location of areas which should have restricted access, such as navigation bridge, machinery spaces of category A and other control stations as defined in chapter II-2, etc.; .3 the location and function of each actual or potential access point to the ship; .4 changes in the tide which may have an impact on the vulnerability or security of the ship; .5 the cargo spaces and stowage arrangements; .6 the locations where the shipís stores and essential maintenance equipment is stored; .7 the locations where unaccompanied baggage is stored; .8 the emergency and stand-by equipment available to maintain essential services; .9 the number of shipís personnel, any existing security duties and any existing training requirement practises of the Company; .10 existing security and safety equipment for the protection of passengers and shipís personnel; .11 escape and evacuation routes and assembly stations which have to be maintained to ensure the orderly and safe emergency evacuation of the ship; .12 existing agreements with private security companies providing ship/waterside security services; and

This includes points of access available to individuals having legitimate access as well as those who seek to obtain unauthorized entry. 8.7 The SSA should consider the continuing relevance of the existing security measures and guidance, procedures and operations, under both routine and emergency conditions and should determine security guidance including: .1 the restricted areas; .2 the response procedures to fire or other emergency conditions; .3 the level of supervision of the shipís personnel, passengers, visitors, vendors, repair technicians, dock workers, etc.; .4 the frequency and effectiveness of security patrols; .5 the access control systems, including identification systems; .6 the security communications systems and procedures; .7 the security doors, barriers and lighting; and .8 the security and surveillance equipment and systems, if any. 8.8 The SSA should consider the persons, activities, services and operations that it is important to protect. This includes: .1 the shipís personnel; .2 passengers, visitors, vendors, repair technicians, port facility personnel, etc; .3 the capacity to maintain safe navigation and emergency response; .4 the cargo, particularly dangerous goods or hazardous substances; .5 the shipís stores; .6 the ship security communication equipment and systems, if any; and .7 the shipís security surveillance equipment and systems, if any. 8.9 The SSA should consider all possible threats, which may include the following types of security incidents: .1 damage to, or destruction of, the ship or of a port facility, e.g. by explosive devices, arson, sabotage or vandalism;

SOLAS/CONF.5/34 ANNEX 1 Page 51 I:\CONF\SOLAS\5\34.DOC .2 hijacking or seizure of the ship or of persons on board; .3 tampering with cargo, essential ship equipment or systems or shipís stores; .4 unauthorized access or use, including presence of stowaways; .5 smuggling weapons or equipment, including weapons of mass destruction; .6 use of the ship to carry those intending to cause a security incident and/or their equipment; .7 use of the ship itself as a weapon or as a means to cause damage or destruction ; .8 attacks from seaward whilst at berth or at anchor; and .9 attacks whilst at sea. 8.10 The SSA should take into account all possible vulnerabilities, which may include: .1 conflicts between safety and security measures; .2 conflicts between shipboard duties and security assignments; .3 watch-keeping duties, number of shipís personnel, particularly with implications on crew fatigue, alertness and performance; .4 any identified security training deficiencies; and .5 any security equipment and systems, including communication systems. 8.11 The CSO and SSO should always have regard to the effect that security measures may have on shipís personnel who will remain on the ship for long periods. When developing security measures, particular consideration should be given to the convenience, comfort and personal privacy of the shipís personnel and their ability to maintain their effectiveness over long periods. 8.12 Upon completion of the SSA, a report shall be prepared, consisting of a summary of how the assessment was conducted, a description of each vulnerability found during the assessment and a description of counter measures that could be used to address each vulnerability. The report shall be protected from unauthorized access or disclosure. 8.13 If the SSA has not been carried out by the Company, the report of the SSA should be reviewed and accepted by the CSO. On-scene security survey 8.14 The on-scene security survey is an integral part of any SSA. The on-scene security survey should examine and evaluate existing shipboard protective measures, procedures and operations for: .1 ensuring the performance of all ship security duties; .2 monitoring restricted areas to ensure that only authorized persons have access;

SOLAS/CONF.5/34 ANNEX 1 Page 52 I:\CONF\SOLAS\5\34.DOC .3 controlling access to the ship, including any identification systems; .4 monitoring of deck areas and areas surrounding the ship; .5 controlling the embarkation of persons and their effects (accompanied and unaccompanied baggage and shipís personnel personal effects); .6 supervising the handling of cargo and the delivery of shipís stores; and .7 ensuring that ship security communication, information, and equipment are readily available. 9 S HIP S ECURITY P LAN General 9.1 The Company Security Officer (CSO) has the responsibility of ensuring that a Ship Security Plan (SSP) is prepared and submitted for approval. The content of each individual SSP should vary depending on the particular ship it covers. The Ship Security Assessment (SSA) will have identified the particular features of the ship and the potential threats and vulnerabilities. The preparation of the SSP will require these features to be addressed in detail. Administrations may prepare advice on the preparation and content of a SSP. 9.2 All SSPs should: .1 detail the organizational structure of security for the ship; .2 detail the shipís relationships with the Company, port facilities, other ships and relevant authorities with security responsibility; .3 detail the communication systems to allow effective continuous communication within the ship and between the ship and others, including port facilities; .4 detail the basic security measures for security level 1, both operational and physical, that will always be in place; .5 detail the additional security measures that will allow the ship to progress without delay to security level 2 and, when necessary, to security level 3; .6 provide for regular review, or audit, of the SSP and for its amendment in response to experience or changing circumstances; and .7 reporting procedures to the appropriate Contracting Governments contact points. 9.3 Preparation of an effective SSP should rest on a thorough assessment of all issues that relate to the security of the ship, including, in particular, a thorough appreciation of the physical and operational characteristics, including the voyage pattern, of the individual ship. 9.4 All SSPs should be approved by, or on behalf of, the Administration. If an Administration uses a Recognized Security Organization (RSO) to review or approve the SSP the RSO should not be associated with any other RSO that prepared, or assisted in the preparation of, the plan.

SOLAS/CONF.5/34 ANNEX 1 Page 53 I:\CONF\SOLAS\5\34.DOC 9.5 CSOs and Ship Security Officers (SSOs) should develop procedures to: .1 assess the continuing effectiveness of the SSP; and .2 prepare amendments of the plan subsequent to its approval. 9.6 The security measures included in the SSP should be in place when the initial verification for compliance with the requirements of chapter XI-2 and part A of this Code will be carried out. Otherwise the process of issue to the ship of the required International Ship Security Certificate cannot be carried out. If there is any subsequent failure of security equipment or systems, or suspension of a security measure for whatever reason, equivalent temporary security measures should be adopted, notified to, and agreed by, the Administration. Organization and performance of ship security duties 9.7 In addition to the guidance given in section 9.2, the SSP should establish the following which relate to all security levels: .1 the duties and responsibilities of all shipboard personnel with a security role; .2 the procedures or safeguards necessary to allow such continuous communications to be maintained at all times; .3 the procedures needed to assess the continuing effectiveness of security procedures and any security and surveillance equipment and systems, including procedures for identifying and responding to equipment or systems failure or malfunction; .4 the procedures and practices to protect security sensitive information held in paper or electronic format; .5 the type and maintenance requirements, of security and surveillance equipment and systems, if any; .6 the procedures to ensure the timely submission, and assessment, of reports relating to possible breaches of security or security concerns; and .7 procedures to establish, maintain and up-date an inventory of any dangerous goods or hazardous substances carried on board, including their location. 9.8 The remainder of this section addresses specifically the security measures that could be taken at each security level covering: .1 access to the ship by shipís personnel, passengers, visitors, etc; .2 restricted areas on the ship; .3 handling of cargo; .4 delivery of shipís stores;

SOLAS/CONF.5/34 ANNEX 1 Page 54 I:\CONF\SOLAS\5\34.DOC .5 handling unaccompanied baggage; and .6 monitoring the security of the ship. Access to the ship 9.9 The SSP should establish the security measures covering all means of access to the ship identified in the SSA. This should include any: .1 access ladders; .2 access gangways; .3 access ramps; .4 access doors, side scuttles, windows and ports; .5 mooring lines and anchor chains; and .6 cranes and hoisting gear. 9.10 For each of these the SSP should identify the appropriate locations where access restrictions or prohibitions should be applied for each of the security levels. For each security level the SSP should establish the type of restriction or prohibition to be applied and the means of enforcing them. 9.11 The SSP should establish for each security level the means of identification required to allow access to the ship and for individuals to remain on the ship without challenge, this may involve developing an appropriate identification system allowing for permanent and temporary identifications, for shipís personnel and visitors respectively. Any ship identification system should, when it is practicable to do so, be co-ordinated with that applying to the port facility. Passengers should be able to prove their identity by boarding passes, tickets, etc., but should not be permitted access to restricted areas unless supervised. The SSP should establish provisions to ensure that the identification systems are regularly updated, and that abuse of procedures should be subject to disciplinary action. 9.12 Those unwilling or unable to establish their identity and/or to confirm the purpose of their visit when requested to do so should be denied access to the ship and their attempt to obtain access should be reported, as appropriate, to the SSOs, the CSOs, the Port Facility Security Officer (PFSO) and to the national or local authorities with security responsibilities. 9.13 The SSP should establish the frequency of application of any access controls particularly if they are to be applied on a random, or occasional, basis. Security Level 1 9.14 At security level 1, the SSP should establish the security measures to control access to the ship, where the following may be applied: .1 checking the identity of all persons seeking to board the ship and confirming their reasons for doing so by checking, for example, joining instructions, passenger tickets, boarding passes, work orders etc;

SOLAS/CONF.5/34 ANNEX 1 Page 55 I:\CONF\SOLAS\5\34.DOC .2 in liaison with the port facility the ship should ensure that designated secure areas are established in which inspections and searching of persons, baggage (including carry on items), personal effects, vehicles and their contents can take place; .3 in liaison with the port facility the ship should ensure that vehicles destined to be loaded on board car carriers, ro-ro and other passenger ships are subjected to search prior to loading, in accordance with the frequency required in the SSP; .4 segregating checked persons and their personal effects from unchecked persons and their personal effects; .5 segregating embarking from disembarking passengers; .6 identification of access points that should be secured or attended to prevent unauthorized access; .7 securing, by locking or other means, access to unattended spaces adjoining areas to which passengers and visitors have access; and .8 providing security briefings to all ship personnel on possible threats, the procedures for reporting suspicious persons, objects or activities and the need for vigilance. 9.15 At security level 1, all those seeking to board a ship should be liable to search. The frequency of such searches, including random searches, should be specified in the approved SSP and should be specifically approved by the Administration. Such searches may best be undertaken by the port facility in close co-operation with the ship and in close proximity to it. Unless there are clear security grounds for doing so, members of the shipís personnel should not be required to search their colleagues or their personal effects. Any such search shall be undertaken in a manner which fully takes into account the human rights of the individual and preserves their basic human dignity. Security Level 2 9.16 At security level 2, the SSP should establish the security measures to be applied to protect against a heightened risk of a security incident to ensure higher vigilance and tighter control, which may include: .1 assigning additional personnel to patrol deck areas during silent hours to deter unauthorized access; .2 limiting the number of access points to the ship, identifying those to be closed and the means of adequately securing them; .3 deterring waterside access to the ship, including , for example, in liaison with the port facility, provision of boat patrols; .4 establishing a restricted area on the shore-side of the ship, in close co-operation with the port facility; .5 increasing the frequency and detail of searches of persons, personal effects, and vehicles being embarked or loaded onto the ship;

SOLAS/CONF.5/34 ANNEX 1 Page 56 I:\CONF\SOLAS\5\34.DOC .6 escorting visitors on the ship; .7 providing additional specific security briefings to all ship personnel on any identified threats, re-emphasising the procedures for reporting suspicious persons, objects, or activities and the stressing the need for increased vigilance; and .8 carrying out a full or partial search of the ship. Security Level 3 9.17 At security level 3, the ship should comply with the instructions issued by those responding to the security incident or threat thereof. The SSP should detail the security measures which could be taken by the ship, in close co-operation with those responding and the port facility, which may include: .1 limiting access to a single, controlled, access point; .2 granting access only to those responding to the security incident or threat thereof; .3 directions of persons on board; .4 suspension of embarkation or disembarkation; .5 suspension of cargo handling operations, deliveries etc; .6 evacuation of the ship; .7 movement of the ship; and .8 preparing for a full or partial search of the ship. Restricted areas on the ship 9.18 The SSP should identify the restricted areas to be established on the ship, specify their extent, times of application, the security measures to be taken to control access to them and those to be taken to control activities within them. The purpose of restricted areas are to: .1 prevent unauthorized access; .2 protect passengers, ship's personnel, and personnel from port facilities or other agencies authorized to be on board the ship; .3 protect sensitive security areas within the ship; and .4 protect cargo and ship's stores from tampering. 9.19 The SSP should ensure that there are clearly established policies and practices to control access to all restricted areas them. 9.20 The SSP should provide that all restricted areas should be clearly marked indicating that access to the area is restricted and that unauthorized presence within the area constitutes a breach of security.

SOLAS/CONF.5/34 ANNEX 1 Page 57 I:\CONF\SOLAS\5\34.DOC 9.21 Restricted areas may include: .1 navigation bridge, machinery spaces of category A and other control stations as defined in chapter II-2; .2 spaces containing security and surveillance equipment and systems and their controls and lighting system controls; .3 ventilation and air-conditioning systems and other similar spaces; .4 spaces with access to potable water tanks, pumps, or manifolds; .5 spaces containing dangerous goods or hazardous substances; .6 spaces containing cargo pumps and their controls; .7 cargo spaces and spaces containing shipís stores; .8 crew accommodation; and .9 any other areas as determined by the CSO, through the SSA to which access must be restricted to maintain the security of the ship. Security Level 1 9.22 At security level 1, the SSP should establish the security measures to be applied to restricted areas, which may include: .1 locking or securing access points; .2 using surveillance equipment to monitor the areas; .3 using guards or patrols; and .4 using automatic intrusion detection devices to alert the shipís personnel of unauthorized access. Security Level 2 9.23 At security level 2, the frequency and intensity of the monitoring of, and control of access to restricted areas should be increased to ensure that only authorized persons have access. The SSP should establish the additional security measures to be applied, which may include: .1 establishing restricted areas adjacent to access points; .2 continuously monitoring surveillance equipment; and .3 dedicating additional personnel to guard and patrol restricted areas. Security Level 3 9.24 At security level 3, the ship should comply with the instructions issued by those responding to the security incident or threat thereof. The SSP should detail the security measures

SOLAS/CONF.5/34 ANNEX 1 Page 58 I:\CONF\SOLAS\5\34.DOC which could be taken by the ship, in close co-operations with those responding and the port facility, which may include: .1 setting up of additional restricted areas on the ship in proximity to the security incident, or the believed location of the security threat, to which access is denied; and .2 searching of restricted areas as part of a search of the ship. Handling of cargo 9.25 The security measures relating to cargo handling should: .1 prevent tampering; and .2 prevent cargo that is not meant for carriage from being accepted and stored on board the ship. 9.26 The security measures, some of which may have to be applied in liaison with the port facility, should include inventory control procedures at access points to the ship. Once on board the ship, cargo should be capable of being identified as having been approved for loading onto the ship. In addition, security measures should be developed to ensure that cargo, once on board, is not tampered with. Security Level 1 9.27 At security level 1, the SSP should establish the security measures to be applied during cargo handling, which may include: .1 routine checking of cargo, cargo transport units and cargo spaces prior to, and during, cargo handling operations; .2 checks to ensure that cargo being loaded matches the cargo documentation; .3 ensuring, in liaison with the port facility, that vehicles to be loaded on board car- carriers, ro-ro and passenger ships are subjected to search prior to loading, in accordance with the frequency required in the SSP; and .4 checking of seals or other methods used to prevent tampering. 9.28 Checking of cargo may be accomplished by the following means: .1 visual and physical examination; and .2 using scanning/detection equipment, mechanical devices, or dogs. 9.29 When there are regular, or repeated, cargo movement the CSO or SSO may, in consultation with the port facility, agree arrangements with shippers or others responsible for such cargo covering off-site checking, sealing, scheduling, supporting documentation, etc. Such arrangements should be communicated to and agreed with the PFSO concerned.

SOLAS/CONF.5/34 ANNEX 1 Page 59 I:\CONF\SOLAS\5\34.DOC Security Level 2 9.30 At security level 2, the SSP should establish the additional security measures to be applied during cargo handling, which may include: .1 detailed checking of cargo, cargo transport units and cargo spaces; .2 intensified checks to ensure that only the intended cargo is loaded; .3 intensified searching of vehicles to be loaded on car-carriers, ro-ro and passenger ships; and .4 increased frequency and detail in checking of seals or other methods used to prevent tampering. 9.31 Detailed checking of cargo may be accomplished by the following means: .1 increasing the frequency and detail of visual and physical examination; .2 increasing the frequency of the use of scanning/detection equipment, mechanical devices, or dogs; and .3 co-ordinating enhanced security measures with the shipper or other responsible party in accordance with an established agreement and procedures. Security Level 3 9.32 At security level 3, the ship should comply with the instructions issued by those responding to the security incident or threat thereof. The SSP should detail the security measures which could be taken by the ship, in close co-operation with those responding and the port facility, which may include: .1 suspension of the loading or unloading of cargo; and .2 verify the inventory of dangerous goods and hazardous substances carried on board, if any, and their location. Delivery of shipís stores 9.33 The security measures relating to the delivery of shipís stores should: .1 ensure checking of shipís stores and package integrity; .2 prevent shipís stores from being accepted without inspection; .3 prevent tampering; and .4 prevent shipís stores from being accepted unless ordered. 9.34 For ships regularly using the port facility it may be appropriate to establish procedures involving the ship, its suppliers and the port facility covering notification and timing of deliveries

SOLAS/CONF.5/34 ANNEX 1 Page 60 I:\CONF\SOLAS\5\34.DOC and their documentation. There should always be some way of confirming that stores presented for delivery are accompanied by evidence that they have been ordered by the ship. Security Level 1 9.35 At security level 1, the SSP should establish the security measures to be applied during delivery of shipís stores, which may include: .1 checking to ensure stores match the order prior to being loaded on board; and .2 ensuring immediate secure stowage of shipís stores. Security Level 2 9.36 At security level 2, the SSP should establish the additional security measures to be applied during delivery of shipís stores by exercising checks prior to receiving stores on board and intensifying inspections. Security Level 3 9.37 At security level 3, the ship should comply with the instructions issued by those responding to the security incident or threat thereof. The SSP should detail the security measures which could be taken by the ship, in close co-operation with those responding and the port facility, which may include: .1 subjecting shipís stores to more extensive checking; .2 preparation for restriction or suspension of handling of shipís stores; and .3 refusal to accept shipís stores on board the ship. Handling unaccompanied baggage 9.38 The SSP should establish the security measures to be applied to ensure that unaccompanied baggage (i.e. any baggage, including personal effects, which is not with the passenger or member of shipís personnel at the point of inspection or search) is identified and subjected to appropriate screening, including searching, before it is accepted on board the ship. It is not envisaged that such baggage will be subjected to screening by both the ship and the port facility, and in cases where both are suitably equipped, the responsibility for screening should rest with the port facility. Close co-operation with the port facility is essential and steps should be taken to ensure that unaccompanied baggage is handled securely after screening. Security Level 1 9.39 At security level 1, the SSP should establish the security measures to be applied when handling unaccompanied baggage to ensure that unaccompanied baggage is screened or searched up to and including 100 percent, which may include use of x-ray screening.

SOLAS/CONF.5/34 ANNEX 1 Page 61 I:\CONF\SOLAS\5\34.DOC Security Level 2 9.40 At security level 2, the SSP should establish the additional security measures to be applied when handling unaccompanied baggage which should include 100 percent x-ray screening of all unaccompanied baggage. Security Level 3 9.41 At security level 3, the ship should comply with the instructions issued by those responding to the security incident or threat thereof. The SSP should detail the security measures which could be taken by the ship, in close co-operation with those responding and the port facility, which may include: .1 subjecting such baggage to more extensive screening, for example x-raying it from at least two different angles; .2 preparation for restriction or suspension of handling of unaccompanied baggage; and .3 refusal to accept unaccompanied baggage on board the ship. Monitoring the Security of the Ship 9.42 The ship should have the capability to monitor the ship, the restricted areas on board and areas surrounding the ship. Such monitoring capabilities may include use of: .1 lighting; .2 watch-keepers, security guards and deck watches including patrols; and .3 automatic intrusion detection devices and surveillance equipment. 9.43 When used, automatic intrusion detection devices should activate an audible and/or visual alarm at a location that is continuously attended or monitored. 9.44 The SSP should establish the procedures and equipment needed at each security level and the means of ensuring that monitoring equipment will be able to perform continually, including consideration of the possible effects of weather conditions or of power disruptions. Security Level 1 9.45 At security level 1, the SSP should establish the security measures to be applied which may be a combination of lighting, watch keepers, security guards or use of security and surveillance equipment to allow shipís security personnel to observe the ship in general, and barriers and restricted areas in particular. 9.46 The ship's deck and access points to the ship should be illuminated during hours of darkness and periods of low visibility while conducting ship/port interface activities or at a port facility or anchorage when necessary. While underway, when necessary, ships should use the maximum lighting available consistent with safe navigation, having regard to the provisions of

SOLAS/CONF.5/34 ANNEX 1 Page 62 I:\CONF\SOLAS\5\34.DOC the International Regulations for the Prevention of Collisions at Sea in force. The following should be considered when establishing the appropriate level and location of lighting: .1 the shipís personnel should be able to detect activities beyond the ship, on both the shore side and the waterside; .2 coverage should include the area on and around the ship; .3 coverage should facilitate personnel identification at access points; and .4 coverage may be provided through coordination with the port facility.

Drills and exercises 13.5 The objective of drills and exercises is to ensure that shipboard personnel are proficient in all assigned security duties at all security levels and the identification of any security related deficiencies, which need to be addressed. 13.6 To ensure the effective implementation of the provisions of the ship security plan, drills should be conducted at least once every three months. In addition, in cases where more than 25 percent of the shipís personnel has been changed, at any one time, with personnel that has not previously participated in any drill on that ship, within the last 3 months, a drill should be conducted within one week of the change. These drills should test individual elements of the plan such as those security threats listed in paragraph 8.9. 13.7 Various types of exercises which may include participation of company security officers, port facility security officers, relevant authorities of Contracting Governments as well as ship security officers, if available, should be carried out at least once each calendar year with no more than 18 months between the exercises. These exercises should test communications, coordination, resource availability, and response. These exercises may be: .1 full scale or live; .2 tabletop simulation or seminar; or .3 combined with other exercises held such as search and rescue or emergency response exercises. 13.8 Company participation in an exercise with another Contracting Government should be recognized by the Administration. 14 P ORT F ACILITY S ECURITY Relevant guidance is provided under section 15, 16 and 18. 15 P ORT F ACILITY S ECURITY A SSESSMENT General 15.1 The Port Facility Security Assessment (PFSA) may be conducted by a Recognized Security Organization (RSO). However, approval of a completed PFSA should only be given by the relevant Contracting Government. 15.2 If a Contracting Government uses a RSO, to review or verify compliance of the PFSA, the RSO should not be associated with any other RSO that prepared or assisted in the preparation of that assessment.

SOLAS/CONF.5/34 ANNEX 1 Page 67 I:\CONF\SOLAS\5\34.DOC 15.3 A PFSA should address the following elements within a port facility: .1 physical security; .2 structural integrity; .3 personnel protection systems; .4 procedural policies; .5 radio and telecommunication systems, including computer systems and networks; .6 relevant transportation infrastructure; .7 utilities; and .8 other areas that may, if damaged or used for illicit observation, pose a risk to persons, property, or operations within the port facility. 15.4 Those involved in a PFSA should be able to draw upon expert assistance in relation to: .1 knowledge of current security threats and patterns; .2 recognition and detection of weapons, dangerous substances and devices; .3 recognition, on a non-discriminatory basis, of characteristics and behavioural patterns of persons who are likely to threaten security; .4 techniques used to circumvent security measures; .5 methods used to cause a security incident; .6 effects of explosives on structures and port facility services; .7 port facility security; .8 port business practices; .9 contingency planning, emergency preparedness and response; .10 physical security measures e.g. fences; .11 radio and telecommunications systems, including computer systems and networks; .12 transport and civil engineering; and .13 ship and port operations. Identification and evaluation of important assets and infrastructure it is important to protect 15.5 The identification and evaluation of important assets and infrastructure is a process through which the relative importance of structures and installations to the functioning of the port

SOLAS/CONF.5/34 ANNEX 1 Page 68 I:\CONF\SOLAS\5\34.DOC facility can be established. This identification and evaluation process is important because it provides a basis for focusing mitigation strategies on those assets and structures which it is more important to protect from a security incident. This process should take into account potential loss of life, the economic significance of the port, symbolic value, and the presence of Government installations. 15.6 Identification and evaluation of assets and infrastructure should be used to prioritise their relative importance for protection. The primary concern should be avoidance of death or injury. It is also important to consider whether the port facility, structure or installation can continue to function without the asset, and the extent to which rapid re-establishment of normal functioning is possible. 15.7 Assets and infrastructure that should be considered important to protect may include: .1 accesses, entrances, approaches, and anchorages, manoeuvring and berthing areas; .2 cargo facilities, terminals, storage areas, and cargo handling equipment; .3 systems such as electrical distribution systems, radio and telecommunication systems and computer systems and networks; .4 port vessel traffic management systems and aids to navigation; .5 power plants, cargo transfer piping, and water supplies; .6 bridges, railways, roads; .7 port service vessels, including pilot boats, tugs, lighters etc; .8 security and surveillance equipment and systems; and .9 the waters adjacent to the port facility. 15.8 The clear identification of assets and infrastructure is essential to the evaluation of the port facilityís security requirements, the prioritisation of protective measures, and decisions concerning the allocation of resources to better protect the port facility. The process may involve consultation with the relevant authorities relating to structures adjacent to the port facility which could cause damage within the facility or be used for the purpose of causing damage to the facility or for illicit observation of the facility or for diverting attention. Identification of the possible threats to the assets and infrastructure and the likelihood of their occurrence, in order to establish and prioritise security measures 15.9 Possible acts that could threaten the security of assets and infrastructure, and the methods of carrying out those acts, should be identified to evaluate the vulnerability of a given asset or location to a security incident, and to establish and prioritise security requirements to enable planning and resource allocations. Identification and evaluation of each potential act and its method should be based on various factors, including threat assessments by Government agencies. By identifying and assessing threats, those conducting the assessment do not have to rely on worst-case scenarios to guide planning and resource allocations.

SOLAS/CONF.5/34 ANNEX 1 Page 69 I:\CONF\SOLAS\5\34.DOC 15.10 The PFSA should include an assessment undertaken in consultation with the relevant national security organizations to determine: .1 any particular aspects of the port facility, including the vessel traffic using the facility, which make it likely to be the target of an attack; .2 the likely consequences in terms of loss of life, damage to property, economic disruption, including disruption to transport systems, of an attack on, or at, the port facility; .3 the capability and intent of those likely to mount such an attack; and .4 the possible type, or types, of attack, producing an overall assessment of the level of risk against which security measures have to be developed. 15.11 The PFSA should consider all possible threats, which may include the following types of security incidents: .1 damage to, or destruction of, the port facility or of the ship, e.g. by explosive devices, arson, sabotage or vandalism; .2 hijacking or seizure of the ship or of persons on board; .3 tampering with cargo, essential ship equipment or systems or shipís stores; .4 unauthorized access or use including presence of stowaways; .5 smuggling weapons or equipment, including weapons of mass destruction; .6 use of the ship to carry those intending to cause a security incident and their equipment; .7 use of the ship itself as a weapon or as a means to cause damage or destruction; .8 blockage; of port entrances, locks, approaches etc; and .9 nuclear, biological and chemical attack. 15.12 The process should involve consultation with the relevant authorities relating to structures adjacent to the port facility which could cause damage within the facility or be used for the purpose of causing damage to the facility or for illicit observation of the facility or for diverting attention. Identification, selection, and prioritisation of countermeasures and procedural changes and their level of effectiveness in reducing vulnerability 15.13 The identification and prioritisation of countermeasures is designed to ensure that the most effective security measures are employed to reduce the vulnerability of a port facility or ship/port interface to the possible threats.

SOLAS/CONF.5/34 ANNEX 1 Page 70 I:\CONF\SOLAS\5\34.DOC 15.14 Security measures should be selected on the basis of factors such as whether they reduce the probability of an attack and should be evaluated using information that includes: .1 security surveys, inspections and audits; .2 consultation with port facility owners and operators, and owners/operators of adjacent structures if appropriate; .3 historical information on security incidents; and .4 operations within the port facility. Identification of vulnerabilities 15.15 Identification of vulnerabilities in physical structures, personnel protection systems, processes, or other areas that may lead to a security incident can be used to establish options to eliminate or mitigate those vulnerabilities. For example, an analysis might reveal vulnerabilities in a port facilityís security systems or unprotected infrastructure such as water supplies, bridges etc that could be resolved through physical measures, e.g. permanent barriers, alarms, surveillance equipment etc. 15.16 Identification of vulnerabilities should include consideration of: .1 waterside and shore-side access to the port facility and ships berthing at the facility; .2 structural integrity of the piers, facilities, and associated structures; .3 existing security measures and procedures, including identification systems; .4 existing security measures and procedures relating to port services and utilities; .5 measures to protect radio and telecommunication equipment, port services and utilities, including computer systems and networks; .6 adjacent areas that may be exploited during, or for, an attack; .7 existing agreements with private security companies providing waterside/shore- side security services; .8 any conflicting policies between safety and security measures and procedures; .9 any conflicting port facility and security duty assignments; .10 any enforcement and personnel constraints; .11 any deficiencies identified during training and drills; and .12 any deficiencies identified during daily operation, following incidents or alerts, the report of security concerns, the exercise of control measures, audits etc.

SOLAS/CONF.5/34 ANNEX 1 Page 71 I:\CONF\SOLAS\5\34.DOC 16 P ORT F ACILITY S ECURITY P LAN General 16.1 Preparation of the Port Facility Security Plan (PFSP) is the responsibility of the Port Facility Security Officer (PFSO). While the PFSO need not necessarily personally undertake all the duties associated with the post the ultimate responsibility for ensuring that they are properly performed remains with the individual PFSO. 16.2 The content of each individual PFSP should vary depending on the particular circumstances of the port facility, or facilities, it covers. The Port Facility Security ( PFSA) will have identified the particular features of the port facility, and of the potential security risks, that have led to the need to appoint a PFSO and to prepare a PFSP. The preparation of the PFSP will require these features, and other local or national security considerations, to be addressed in the PFSP and for appropriate security measures to be established so as to minimise the likelihood of a breach of security and the consequences of potential risks. Contracting Governments may prepare advice on the preparation and content of a PFSP. 16.3 All PFSPs should: .1 detail the security organization of the port facility, .2 the organizationís links with other relevant authorities and the necessary communication systems to allow the effective continuous operation of the organization and its links with others, including ships in port; .3 detail the basic security level 1 measures, both operational and physical, that will be in place; .4 detail the additional security measures that will allow the port facility to progress without delay to security level 2 and, when necessary, to security level 3; .5 provide for regular review, or audit, of the PFSP and for its amendments in response to experience or changing circumstances; and .6 reporting procedures to the appropriate Contracting Governments contact points. 16.4 Preparation of an effective PFSP will rest on a thorough assessment of all issues that relate to the security of the port facility, including, in particular, a thorough appreciation of the physical and operational characteristics of the individual port facility. 16.5 Contracting Government should approve the PFSPs of the port facilities under their jurisdiction. Contracting Governments should develop procedures to assess the continuing effectiveness of each PFSP and may require amendment of the PFSP prior to its initial approval or subsequent to its approval. The PFSP should make provision for the retention of records of security incidents and threats, reviews, audits, training, drills and exercises as evidence of compliance with those requirements. 16.6 The security measures included in the PFSP should be in place within a reasonable period of the PFSPís approval and the PFSP should establish when each measure will be in place. If there is likely to be any delay in their provision this should be discussed with the Contracting Government responsible for approval of the PFSP and satisfactory alternative temporary security

SOLAS/CONF.5/34 ANNEX 1 Page 72 I:\CONF\SOLAS\5\34.DOC measures that provide an equivalent level of security should be agreed to cover any interim period. 16.7 The use of firearms on or near ships and in port facilities may pose particular and significant safety risks, in particular in connection with certain dangerous or hazardous substances and should be considered very carefully. In the event that a Contracting Government decides that it is necessary to use armed personnel in these areas, that Contracting Government should ensure that these personnel are duly authorized and trained in the use of their weapons and that they are aware of the specific risks to safety that are present in these areas. If a Contracting Government authorizes the use of firearms they should issue specific safety guidelines on their use. The PFSP should contain specific guidance on this matter in particular with regard its application to ships carrying dangerous goods or hazardous substances. Organization and performance of port facility security duties 16.8 In addition to the guidance given under section 16.3, the PFSP should establish the following which relate to all security levels: .1 the role and structure of the port facility security organization; .2 the duties, responsibilities and training requirements of all port facility personnel with a security role and the performance measures needed to allow their individual effectiveness to be assessed; .3 the port facility security organizationís links with other national or local authorities with security responsibilities; .4 the communication systems provided to allow effective and continuous communication between port facility security personnel, ships in port and, when appropriate, with national or local authorities with security responsibilities; .5 the procedures or safeguards necessary to allow such continuous communications to be maintained at all times; .6 the procedures and practices to protect security sensitive information held in paper or electronic format; .7 the procedures to assess the continuing effectiveness of security measures, procedures and equipment, including identification of, and response to, equipment failure or malfunction; .8 the procedures to allow the submission, and assessment, of reports relating to possible breaches of security or security concerns; .9 procedures relating to cargo handling; .10 procedures covering the delivery of shipís stores; .11 the procedures to maintain, and update, records of dangerous goods and hazardous substances and their location within the port facility;

SOLAS/CONF.5/34 ANNEX 1 Page 73 I:\CONF\SOLAS\5\34.DOC .12 the means of alerting and obtaining the services of waterside patrols and specialist search teams, including bomb searches and underwater searches; .13 the procedures for assisting ship security officers in confirming the identity of those seeking to board the ship when requested; and .14 the procedures for facilitating shore leave for shipís personnel or personnel changes, as well as access of visitors to the ship including representatives of seafarersí welfare and labour organizations. 16.9 The remainder of this section addresses specifically the security measures that could be taken at each security level covering: .1 access to the port facility; .2 restricted areas within the port facility; .3 handling of cargo; .4 delivery of shipís stores; .5 handling unaccompanied baggage; and .6 monitoring the security of the port facility. Access to the port facility 16.10 The PFSP should establish the security measures covering all means of access to the port facility identified in the PFSA. 16.11 For each of these the PFSP should identify the appropriate locations where access restrictions or prohibitions should be applied for each of the security levels. For each security level the PFSP should specify the type of restriction or prohibition to be applied and the means of enforcing them. 16.12 The PFSP should establish for each security level the means of identification required to allow access to the port facility and for individuals to remain within the port facility without challenge, this may involve developing an appropriate identification system allowing for permanent and temporary identifications, for port facility personnel and for visitors respectively. Any port facility identification system should, when it is practicable to do so, be co-ordinated with that applying to ships that regularly use the port facility. Passengers should be able to prove their identity by boarding passes, tickets, etc., but should not be permitted access to restricted areas unless supervised. The PFSP should establish provisions to ensure that the identification systems are regularly updated, and that abuse of procedures should be subject to disciplinary action. 16.13 Those unwilling or unable to establish their identity and/or to confirm the purpose of their visit when requested to do so should be denied access to the port facility and their attempt to obtain access should be reported to the PFSO and to the national or local authorities with security responsibilities.

SOLAS/CONF.5/34 ANNEX 1 Page 74 I:\CONF\SOLAS\5\34.DOC 16.14 The PFSP should identify the locations where persons, personal effects, and vehicle searches are to be undertaken. Such locations should be covered to facilitate continuous operation regardless of prevailing weather conditions, in accordance with the frequency laid down in the PFSP. Once subjected to search persons, personal effects and vehicles should proceed directly to the restricted holding, embarkation or car loading areas. 16.15 The PFSP should establish separate locations for checked and unchecked persons and their effects and if possible separate areas for embarking/disembarking passengers, shipís personnel and their effects to ensure that unchecked persons are not able to come in contact with checked persons. 16.16 The PFSP should establish the frequency of application of any access controls particularly if they are to be applied on a random, or occasional, basis. Security Level 1 16.17 At security level 1, the PFSP should establish the control points where the following security measures may be applied: .1 restricted areas which should be bound by fencing or other barriers to a standard which should be approved by the Contracting Government; .2 checking identity of all persons seeking entry to the port facility in connection with a ship, including passengers, shipís personnel and visitors and confirming their reasons for doing so by checking, for example, joining instructions, passenger tickets, boarding passes, work orders, etc; .3 checking vehicles used by those seeking entry to the port facility in connection with a ship; .4 verification of the identity of port facility personnel and those employed within the port facility and their vehicles; .5 restricting access to exclude those not employed by the port facility or working within it, if they are unable to establish their identity; .6 undertaking searches of persons, personal effects, vehicles and their contents; and .7 identification of any access points not in regular use which should be permanently closed and locked. 16.18 At security level 1, all those seeking access to the port facility should be liable to search. The frequency of such searches, including random searches, should be specified in the approved PFSP and should be specifically approved by the Contracting Government. Unless there are clear security grounds for doing so, members of the shipís personnel should not be required to search their colleagues or their personal effects. Any such search shall be undertaken in a manner which fully takes into account the human rights of the individual and preserves their basic human dignity.

SOLAS/CONF.5/34 ANNEX 1 Page 75 I:\CONF\SOLAS\5\34.DOC Security Level 2 16.19 At security level 2, the PFSP should establish the additional security measures to be applied, which may include: .1 assigning additional personnel to guard access points and patrol perimeter barriers; .2 limiting the number of access points to the port facility, and identify those to be closed and the means of adequately securing them; .3 providing for means of impeding movement through the remaining access points, e.g. security barriers; .4 increasing the frequency of searches of persons, personal effects, and vehicle; .5 deny access to visitors who are unable to provide a verifiable justification for seeking access to the port facility; and .6 using of patrol vessels to enhance waterside security. Security Level 3 16.20 At security level 3, the port facility should comply with instructions issued by those responding to the security incident or threat thereof. The PFSP should detail the security measures which could be taken by the port facility, in close co-operation with those responding and the ships at the port facility, which may include: .1 suspension of access to all, or part of, the port facility; .2 granting access only to those responding to the security incident or threat thereof; .3 suspension of pedestrian or vehicular movement within all, or part, of the port facility; .4 increased security patrols within the port facility, if appropriate; .5 suspension of port operations within all, or part, of the port facility; .6 direction of vessel movements relating to all, or part, of the port facility; and .7 evacuation of all, or part of, the port facility. Restricted areas within the port facility 16.21 The PFSP should identify the restricted areas to be established within the port facility, specify their extent, times of application, the security measures to be taken to control access to them and those to be taken to control activities within them. This should also include, in appropriate circumstances, measures to ensure that temporary restricted areas are security swept both before and after that area is established. The purpose of restricted areas is to:

SOLAS/CONF.5/34 ANNEX 1 Page 76 I:\CONF\SOLAS\5\34.DOC .1 protect passengers, shipís personnel, port facility personnel and visitors, including those visiting in connection with a ship; .2 protect the port facility; .3 protect ships using, and serving, the port facility; .4 protect sensitive security locations and areas within the port facility; .5 to protect security and surveillance equipment and systems; and .6 protect cargo and shipís stores from tampering. 16.22 The PFSP should ensure that all restricted areas have clearly established security measures to control: .1 access by individuals; .2 the entry, parking, loading and unloading of vehicles; .3 movement and storage of cargo and shipís stores; and .4 unaccompanied baggage or personal effects. 16.23 The PFSP should provide that all restricted areas should be clearly marked indicating that access to the area is restricted and that unauthorized presence within the area constitutes a breach of security. 16.24 When automatic intrusion detection devices are installed they should alert a control centre which can respond to the triggering of an alarm. 16.25 Restricted areas may include: .1 shore and waterside areas immediately adjacent to the ship; .2 embarkation and disembarkation areas, passenger and shipís personnel holding and processing areas including search points; .3 areas where loading, unloading or storage of cargo and stores is undertaken; .4 locations where security sensitive information, including cargo documentation, is held; .5 areas where dangerous goods and hazardous substances are held; .6 vessel traffic management system control rooms, aids to navigation and port control buildings, including security and surveillance control rooms; .7 areas where security and surveillance equipment are stored or located; .8 essential electrical, radio and telecommunication, water and other utility installations; and

SOLAS/CONF.5/34 ANNEX 1 Page 77 I:\CONF\SOLAS\5\34.DOC .9 other locations in the port facility where access by vessels, vehicles and individuals should be restricted. 16.26 The security measures may extend, with the agreement of the relevant authorities, to restrictions on unauthorized access to structures from which the port facility can be observed. Security Level 1 16.27 At security level 1, the PFSP should establish the security measures to be applied to restricted areas, which may include: .1 provision of permanent or temporary barriers to surround the restricted area whose standard should be accepted by the Contracting Government; .2 provision of access points where access can be controlled by security guards when in operation and which can be effectively locked or barred when not in use; .3 providing passes which must be displayed to identify individuals entitlement to be within the restricted area; .4 clearly marking vehicles allowed access to restricted areas; .5 providing guards and patrols; .6 providing automatic intrusion detection devices, or surveillance equipment or systems to detect unauthorized access into, or movement within restricted areas; and .7 control of the movement of vessels in the vicinity of ships using the port facility. Security Level 2 16.28 At security level 2, the PFSP should establish the enhancement of the frequency and intensity of the monitoring of, and control of access to, restricted areas. The PFSP should establish the additional security measures, which may include: .1 enhancing the effectiveness of the barriers or fencing surrounding restricted areas, including the use of patrols or automatic intrusion detection devices; .2 reducing the number of access points to restricted areas and enhancing the controls applied at the remaining accesses; .3 restrictions on parking adjacent to berthed ships; .4 further restricting access to the restricted areas and movements and storage within them; .5 use of continuously monitored and recording surveillance equipment; .6 enhancing the number and frequency of patrols including waterside patrols undertaken on the boundaries of the restricted areas and within the areas;

SOLAS/CONF.5/34 ANNEX 1 Page 78 I:\CONF\SOLAS\5\34.DOC .7 establishing and restricting access to areas adjacent to the restricted areas; and .8 enforcing restrictions on access by unauthorized craft to the waters adjacent to ships using the port facility. Security Level 3 16.29 At security level 3, the port facility should comply with the instructions issued by those responding to the security incident or threat thereof. The PFSP should detail the security measures which could be taken by the port facility, in close co-operation with those responding and the ships at the port facility, which may include: .1 setting up of additional restricted areas within the port facility in proximity to the security incident, or the believed location of the security threat, to which access is denied; and .2 preparing for the searching of restricted areas as part of a search of all, or part, of the port facility. Handling of cargo 16.30 The security measures relating to cargo handling should: .1 prevent tampering; and .2 prevent cargo that is not meant for carriage from being accepted and stored within the port facility. 16.31 The security measures should include inventory control procedures at access points to the port facility. Once within the port facility cargo should be capable of being identified as having been checked and accepted for loading onto a ship or for temporary storage in a restricted area while awaiting loading. It may be appropriate to restrict the entry of cargo to the port facility that does not have a confirmed date for loading. Security Level 1 16.32 At security level 1, the PFSP should establish the security measures to be applied during cargo handling, which may include: .1 routine checking of cargo, cargo transport units and cargo storage areas within the port facility prior to, and during, cargo handling operations; .2 checks to ensure that cargo entering the port facility matches the delivery note or equivalent cargo documentation; .3 searches of vehicles; and .4 checking of seals and other methods used to prevent tampering upon entering the port facility and upon storage within the port facility.

SOLAS/CONF.5/34 ANNEX 1 Page 79 I:\CONF\SOLAS\5\34.DOC 16.33 Checking of cargo may be accomplished by some or all of the following means: .1 visual and physical examination; and .2 using scanning/detection equipment, mechanical devices, or dogs. 16.34 When there are regular, or repeated, cargo movement the Company Security Officer (CSO) or the Ship Security Officer (SSO) may, in consultation with the port facility, agree arrangements with shippers or others responsible for such cargo covering off-site checking, sealing, scheduling, supporting documentation, etc. Such arrangements should be communicated to and agreed with the PFSO concerned. Security Level 2 16.35 At security level 2, the PFSP should establish the additional security measures to be applied during cargo handling to enhance control, which may include: .1 detailed checking of cargo, cargo transport units and cargo storage areas within the port facility; .2 intensified checks, as appropriate, to ensure that only the documented cargo enters the port facility, is temporarily stored there and then loaded onto the ship; .3 intensified searches of vehicles; and .4 increased frequency and detail in checking of seals and other methods used to prevent tampering. 16.36 Detailed checking of cargo may be accomplished by some or all of the following means: .1 increasing the frequency and detail of checking of cargo, cargo transport units and cargo storage areas within the port facility (visual and physical examination); .2 increasing the frequency of the use of scanning/detection equipment, mechanical devices, or dogs; and .3 co-ordinating enhanced security measures with the shipper or other responsible party in addition to an established agreement and procedures. Security Level 3 16.37 At security level 3, the port facility should comply with the instructions issued by those responding to the security incident or threat thereof. The PFSP should detail the security measures which could be taken by the port facility, in close co-operation with those responding and the ships at the port facility, which may include: .1 restriction or suspension of cargo movements or operations within all, or part, of the port facility or specific ships; and .2 verifying the inventory of dangerous goods and hazardous substances held within the port facility and their location.

SOLAS/CONF.5/34 ANNEX 1 Page 80 I:\CONF\SOLAS\5\34.DOC Delivery of shipís stores 16.38 The security measures relating to the delivery of shipís stores should: .1 ensure checking of shipís stores and package integrity; .2 prevent shipís stores from being accepted without inspection; .3 prevent tampering; .4 prevent shipís stores from being accepted unless ordered; .5 ensure searching the delivery vehicle; and .6 ensure escorting delivery vehicles within the port facility. 16.39 For ships regularly using the port facility it may be appropriate to establish procedures involving the ship, its suppliers and the port facility covering notification and timing of deliveries and their documentation. There should always be some way of confirming that stores presented for delivery are accompanied by evidence that they have been ordered by the ship. Security Level 1 16.40 At security level 1, the PFSP should establish the security measures to be applied to control the delivery of shipís stores, which may include: .1 checking of shipís stores; .2 advance notification as to composition of load, driver details and vehicle registration; and .3 searching the delivery vehicle. 16.41 Checking of shipís stores may be accomplished by some or all of the following means: .1 visual and physical examination; and .2 using scanning/detection equipment, mechanical devices or dogs. Security Level 2 16.42 At security level 2, the PFSP should establish the additional security measures to be applied to enhance the control of the delivery of shipís stores, which may include: .1 detailed checking of shipís stores; .2 detailed searches of the delivery vehicles; .3 co-ordination with ship personnel to check the order against the delivery note prior to entry to the port facility; and .4 escorting the delivery vehicle within the port facility.

SOLAS/CONF.5/34 ANNEX 1 Page 81 I:\CONF\SOLAS\5\34.DOC 16.43 Detailed checking of shipís stores may be accomplished by some or all of the following means: .1 increasing the frequency and detail of searches of delivery vehicles; .2 increasing the use of scanning/detection equipment, mechanical devices, or dogs; and .3 restricting, or prohibiting, entry of stores that will not leave the port facility within a specified period. Security Level 3 16.44 At security level 3, the port facility should comply with the instructions issued by those responding to the security incident or threat thereof. The PFSP should detail the security measures which could be taken by the port facility, in close co-operation with those responding and the ships at the port facility which may include preparation for restriction, or suspension, of the delivery of shipís stores within all, or part, of the port facility. Handling unaccompanied baggage 16.45 The PFSP should establish the security measures to be applied to ensure that unaccompanied baggage (i.e. any baggage, including personal effects, which is not with the passenger or member of shipís personnel at the point of inspection or search) is identified and subjected to appropriate screening, including searching, before is allowed in the port facility and, depending on the storage arrangements, before it is transferred between the port facility and the ship. It is not envisaged that such baggage will be subjected to screening by both the port facility and the ship, and in cases where both are suitably equipped, the responsibility for screening should rest with the port facility. Close co-operation with the ship is essential and steps should be taken to ensure that unaccompanied baggage is handled securely after screening. Security Level 1 16.46 At security level 1, the PFSP should establish the security measures to be applied when handling unaccompanied baggage to ensure that unaccompanied baggage is screened or searched up to and including 100 percent, which may include use of x-ray screening. Security Level 2 16.47 At security level 2, the PFSP should establish the additional security measures to be applied when handling unaccompanied baggage which should include 100 percent x-ray screening of all unaccompanied baggage. Security Level 3 16.48 At security level 3, the port facility should comply with the instructions issued by those responding to the security incident or threat thereof. The PFSP should detail the security measures which could be taken by the port facility, in close co-operation with those responding and the ships at the port facility, which may include:

SOLAS/CONF.5/34 ANNEX 1 Page 82 I:\CONF\SOLAS\5\34.DOC .1 subjecting such baggage to more extensive screening, for example x-raying it from at least two different angles; .2 preparations for restriction or suspension of handling or unaccompanied baggage; and .3 refusal to accept unaccompanied baggage into the port facility. Monitoring the security of the port facility 16.49 The port facility security organization should have the capability to monitor the port facility and its nearby approaches, on land and water, at all times, including the night hours and periods of limited visibility, the restricted areas within the port facility, the ships at the port facility and areas surrounding ships. Such monitoring can include use of: .1 lighting; .2 security guards, including foot, vehicle and waterborne patrols; and .3 automatic intrusion detection devices and surveillance equipment. 16.50 When used, automatic intrusion detection devices should activate an audible and/or visual alarm at a location that is continuously attended or monitored. 16.51 The PFSP should establish the procedures and equipment needed at each security level and the means of ensuring that monitoring equipment will be able to perform continually, including consideration of the possible effects of weather or of power disruptions. Security Level 1 16.52 At security level 1, the PFSP should establish the security measures to be applied which may be a combination of lighting, security guards or use of security and surveillance equipment to allow port facility security personnel to: .1 observe the general port facility area, including shore and water-side accesses to it; .2 observe access points, barriers and restricted areas; and .3 allow port facility security personnel to monitor areas and movements adjacent to ships using the port facility, including augmentation of lighting provided by the ship itself. Security Level 2 16.53 At security level 2, the PFSP should establish the additional security measures to be applied to enhance the monitoring and surveillance capability, which may include: .1 increasing the coverage and intensity of lighting and surveillance equipment, including the provision of additional lighting and surveillance coverage;

SOLAS/CONF.5/34 ANNEX 1 Page 83 I:\CONF\SOLAS\5\34.DOC .2 increasing the frequency of foot, vehicle or waterborne patrols; and .3 assigning additional security personnel to monitor and patrol. Security Level 3 16.54 At security level 3, the port facility should comply with the instructions issued by those responding to the security incident or threat thereof.
