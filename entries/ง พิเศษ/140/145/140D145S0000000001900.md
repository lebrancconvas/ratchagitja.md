- 9 - ANNEX A CODE ON THE ENHANCED PROGRAMME OF INSPECTIONS DURING THE SURVEYS OF BULK CARRIERS Part A CODE ON THE ENHANCED PROGRAMME OF INSPECTIONS DURING SURVEYS OF BULK CARRIERS HAVING SINGLE-SIDE SKIN CONSTRUCTION 1 General 1.1 Application 1.1.1 The Code should apply to all self-propelled bulk carriers of 500 gross tonnage and above other than double-side skin bulk carriers as defined in paragraph 1.2.1 of part B of annex A. 1.1.2 The Code should apply to surveys of hull structure and piping systems in way of cargo holds, cofferdams, pipe tunnels, void spaces, fuel oil tanks, within the cargo length area and all ballast tanks. 1.1.3 The Code contains the minimum extent of examination, thickness measurements and tank testing. The survey should be extended when substantial corrosion and/or structural defects are found and include additional close-up survey when necessary. 1.1.4 Ships subject to compliance with regulation XII/6.1 of the Convention should be subject to the additional thickness measurement guidance contained in annex 11. 1.1.5 Ships subject to compliance with resolution MSC.168(79) should be subject to the additional thickness measurement guidance contained in annex 15. 1.1.6 For bulk carriers with hybrid cargo hold arrangements, e.g. with some cargo holds of single-side skin and others of double-side skin, the requirements of part B of annex A apply to cargo holds of double-side skin and associated wing spaces. 1.1.7 The surveys should be carried out during the surveys prescribed by regulation I/10 of the 1974 SOLAS Convention, as amended. 1.2 Definitions 1.2.1 Bulk carrier is a ship which is constructed generally with single deck, topside tanks and hopper side tanks in cargo spaces, and is intended primarily to carry dry cargo in bulk and includes combination carriers. 1.2.2 Ballast tank is a tank which is used for salt water ballast, or, where applicable, a space which is used for both cargo and salt water ballast will be treated as a ballast tank when substantial corrosion has been found in that space. 1.2.3 Spaces are separate compartments including holds, tanks, cofferdams and void spaces bounding cargo holds, decks and the outer hull. RESOLUTION A.1049(27) adopted on 30 November 2011 INTERNATIONAL CODE ON THE ENHANCED PROGRAMME OF INSPECTIONS DURING SURVEYS OF BULK CARRIERS AND OIL TANKERS, 2001 (2011 ESP CODE)

- 10 - 1.2.4 Overall survey is a survey intended to report on the overall condition of the hull structure and determine the extent of additional close-up surveys. 1.2.5 Close-up survey is a survey where the details of structural components are within the close visual inspection range of the surveyor, i.e. normally within reach of hand. 1.2.6 Transverse section is the cross section of the hull perpendicular to the ship's centerline and includes all longitudinal members such as plating, longitudinals and girders at the deck, side and bottom, inner bottom and hopper side plating, longitudinal bulkheads, and bottom plating in top wing tanks. 1.2.7 Representative spaces are those which are expected to reflect the condition of other spaces of similar type and service and with similar corrosion prevention systems. When selecting representative spaces account should be taken of the service and repair history on board and identifiable critical and/or suspect areas. 1.2.8 Suspect areas are locations showing substantial corrosion and/or are considered by the surveyor to be prone to rapid wastage. 1.2.9 Substantial corrosion is an extent of corrosion such that assessment of corrosion pattern indicates wastage in excess of 75% of allowable margins, but within acceptable limits. For ships built under the IACS Common Structural Rules, substantial corrosion is an extent of corrosion such that the assessment of the corrosion pattern indicates a gauged (or measured) thickness between t net + 0.5 mm and t net . 1.2.10 A corrosion prevention system is normally considered a full hard protective coating. Hard protective coating should usually be epoxy coating or equivalent. Other coating systems, which are neither soft nor semi-hard coatings, may be considered acceptable as alternatives provided that they are applied and maintained in compliance with the manufacturer's specifications. 1.2.11 Coating condition is defined as follows: GOOD condition with only minor spot rusting; FAIR condition with local breakdown of coating at edges of stiffeners and weld connections and/or light rusting over 20% or more of areas under consideration, but less than as defined for POOR condition; and POOR condition with general breakdown of coating over 20% or more of areas or hard scale at 10% or more of areas under consideration. 1.2.12 Critical structural areas are locations which have been identified from calculations to require monitoring or from the service history of the subject ship or from similar or sister ships to be sensitive to cracking, buckling or corrosion which would impair the structural integrity of the ship. 1.2.13 Cargo length area is that part of the ship which includes cargo holds and adjacent areas including fuel tanks, cofferdams, ballast tanks and void spaces. 1.2.14 Intermediate survey is a survey carried out either at the second or third annual survey or between these surveys. RESOLUTION A.1049(27) adopted on 30 November 2011 INTERNATIONAL CODE ON THE ENHANCED PROGRAMME OF INSPECTIONS DURING SURVEYS OF BULK CARRIERS AND OIL TANKERS, 2001 (2011 ESP CODE)

- 11 - 1.2.15 A prompt and thorough repair is a permanent repair completed at the time of survey to the satisfaction of the surveyor, therein removing the need for the imposition of any associated condition of classification or recommendation. 1.2.16 Convention means the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea, 1974, as amended. 1.2.17 Specially considered (in connection with close-up surveys and thickness measurements) means sufficient close-up inspection and thickness measurements are taken to confirm the actual average condition of the structure under the coating. 1.3 Repairs 1.3.1 Any damage in association with wastage over the allowable limits (including buckling, grooving, detachment or fracture), or extensive areas of wastage over the allowable limits, which affects or, in the opinion of the Administration, will affect the ship's structural, watertight or weathertight integrity, should be promptly and thoroughly (see 1.2.15) repaired. Areas to be considered include: .1 side structure and side plating; .2 deck structure and deck plating; .3 bottom structure and bottom plating; .4 inner bottom structure and inner bottom plating; .5 inner side structure and inner side plating; .6 watertight or oiltight bulkheads; .7 hatch covers or hatch coamings; and .8 items in 3.3.10. For locations where adequate repair facilities are not available, the Administration may allow the ship to proceed directly to a repair facility. This may require discharging the cargo and/or temporary repairs for the intended voyage. 1.3.2 Additionally, when a survey results in the identification of corrosion or structural defects, either of which, in the opinion of the Administration, will impair the ship's fitness for continued service, remedial measures should be implemented before the ship continues in service. 1.4 Surveyors For bulk carriers of 20,000 tons deadweight and above, two surveyors should jointly carry out the first scheduled renewal survey after the bulk carrier passes 10 years of age (i.e. third renewal survey), and all subsequent renewal surveys and intermediate surveys. On bulk carriers of 100,000 tons deadweight and above, the intermediate survey between 10 and 15 years of age should be performed by two surveyors. If the surveys are carried out by a recognized organization, the surveyors should be exclusively employed by such recognized organizations.

- 12 - 1.5 Thickness measurements and close-up surveys In any kind of survey, i.e. renewal, intermediate, annual or other surveys having the scope of the foregoing ones, thickness measurements of structures in areas where close-up surveys are required should be carried out simultaneously with close-up surveys. 2 Renewal survey 2.1 General 2.1.1 The renewal survey may be commenced at the fourth annual survey and be progressed during the succeeding year with a view to completion by the fifth anniversary date. 2.1.2 As part of the preparation for the renewal survey, the survey programme should be dealt with in advance of the survey. The thickness measurement should not be held before the fourth annual survey. 2.1.3 The survey should include, in addition to the requirements of the annual survey, examination, tests and checks of sufficient extent to ensure that the hull and related piping, as required in 2.1.5, is in a satisfactory condition and is fit for its intended purpose for the new period of validity of the Cargo Ship Safety Construction Certificate, subject to proper maintenance and operation and to periodical surveys being carried out at the due dates. 2.1.4 All cargo holds, ballast tanks, pipe tunnels, cofferdams and void spaces bounding cargo holds, decks and outer hull should be examined, and this examination should be supplemented by thickness measurement and testing as required by 2.6 and 2.7, to ensure that the structural integrity remains effective. The examination should be sufficient to discover substantial corrosion, significant deformation, fractures, damages or other structural deterioration, that may be present. 2.1.5 All piping systems within the above spaces should be examined and operationally tested under working pressure to the attending surveyor's satisfaction to ensure that the tightness and condition remain satisfactory. 2.1.6 The survey extent of ballast tanks converted to void spaces should be specially considered in relation to the requirements for ballast tanks. 2.1.7 Concurrent crediting to both intermediate survey and renewal survey for surveys and thickness measurements of spaces should not be acceptable. 2.2 Dry-dock survey 2.2.1 A survey in dry-dock should be a part of the renewal survey. There should be a minimum of two inspections of the outside of the ship's bottom during the five-year period of the certificate. In all cases, the maximum interval between bottom inspections should not exceed 36 months. 2.2.2 For ships of 15 years of age and over, inspection of the outside of the ship's bottom should be carried out with the ship in dry-dock. For ships of less than 15 years of age, alternate inspections of the ship's bottom not conducted in conjunction with the renewal survey may be carried out with the ship afloat. Inspection of the ship afloat should only be carried out when the conditions are satisfactory and the proper equipment and suitably qualified staff is available. RESOLUTION A.1049(27) adopted on 30 November 2011 INTERNATIONAL CODE ON THE ENHANCED PROGRAMME OF INSPECTIONS DURING SURVEYS OF BULK CARRIERS AND OIL TANKERS, 2001 (2011 ESP CODE)

- 13 - 2.2.3 If a survey in dry-dock is not completed in conjunction with the renewal survey or if the 36 month maximum interval referred to in 2.2.1 is not complied with, the Cargo Ship Safety Construction Certificate should cease to be valid until a survey in dry-dock is completed. 2.2.4 The overall and close-up surveys and thickness measurements, as applicable, of the lower portions of the cargo holds and ballast tanks should be carried out in accordance with the applicable requirements for renewal surveys, if not already performed. Note: Lower portions of the cargo holds and ballast tanks are considered to be the parts below light ballast water line. 2.3 Space protection 2.3.1 Where provided, the condition of the corrosion prevention system of ballast tanks should be examined. For ballast tanks, excluding double-bottom tanks, where a hard protective coating is found in POOR condition as defined in 1.2.11, and it is not renewed, or where a soft or semi-hard coating has been applied, or where a hard protective coating has not been applied from the time of construction, the tanks in question should be examined at annual intervals. Thickness measurements should be carried out as deemed necessary by the surveyor. When such breakdown of hard protective coating is found in water ballast double-bottom tanks and it is not renewed, where a soft or semi-hard coating has been applied or where a hard protective coating has not been applied from the time of construction, the tanks in question may be examined at annual intervals. When considered necessary by the surveyor, or where extensive corrosion exists, thickness measurement should be carried out. 2.3.2 Where a hard protective coating is provided in cargo holds and is found in GOOD condition, the extent of close-up surveys and thickness measurements may be specially considered. 2.4 Hatch covers and coamings The hatch covers and coamings should be surveyed as follows: 2.4.1 A thorough inspection of the items listed in 3.3 should be carried out in addition to all hatch covers and coamings. 2.4.2 Checking of the satisfactory operation of all mechanically operated hatch covers should be made, including: .1 stowage and securing in open condition; .2 proper fit and efficiency of sealing in closed condition; and .3 operational testing of hydraulic and power components, wires, chains, and link drives. 2.4.3 The effectiveness of sealing arrangements of all hatch covers by hose testing or equivalent should be checked. 2.4.4 Thickness measurement of the hatch cover and coaming plating and stiffeners should be carried out as given in annex 2. RESOLUTION A.1049(27) adopted on 30 November 2011 INTERNATIONAL CODE ON THE ENHANCED PROGRAMME OF INSPECTIONS DURING SURVEYS OF BULK CARRIERS AND OIL TANKERS, 2001 (2011 ESP CODE)

- 14 - 2.5 Extent of overall and close-up surveys 2.5.1 An overall survey of all tanks and spaces should be carried out at the renewal survey. Fuel oil tanks in the cargo length area should be surveyed as follows: Renewal survey No.1 Age İ 5 Renewal survey No.2 5 < Age İ 10 Renewal survey No.3 10 < Age İ 15 Renewal survey No.4 and subsequent 15 < Age None One Two Half, minimum two Notes: 1. These requirements apply to tanks of integral (structural) type. 2. If a selection of tanks is accepted to be examined, then different tanks should be examined at each renewal survey, on a rotational basis. 3. Peak tanks (all uses) should be examined internally at each renewal survey. 4. At renewal survey No.3 and subsequent renewal surveys, one deep tank for fuel oil in the cargo area should be included, if fitted. 2.5.2 The minimum requirements for close-up surveys at renewal survey are given in annex 1. 2.5.3 The surveyor may extend the close-up survey as deemed necessary taking into account the maintenance of the spaces under survey, the condition of the corrosion prevention system and where spaces have structural arrangements or details which have suffered defects in similar spaces or on similar ships according to the available information. 2.5.4 For areas in spaces where hard protective coatings are found to be in a GOOD condition, the extent of close-up surveys according to annex 1 may be specially considered. Refer also to 2.3.2. 2.6 Extent of thickness measurements 2.6.1 The minimum requirements for thickness measurements at the renewal survey are given in annex 2. Annex 11 provides additional thickness measurement guidelines applicable to the vertically corrugated transverse watertight bulkhead between cargo holds No.1 and No.2 on ships subject to compliance with regulation XII/6.1 of the Convention. For additional thickness measurement guidelines applicable to the side shell frames and brackets on ships subject to compliance with resolution MSC.168(79), reference is made to 1.1.5 and annex 15. 2.6.2 Representative thickness measurements to determine both general and local levels of corrosion in the shell frames and their end attachments in all cargo holds and ballast tanks should be carried out. Thickness measurement should also be carried out to determine the corrosion levels on the transverse bulkhead plating. The extent of thickness measurements may be specially considered provided the surveyor is satisfied by the close-up examination, that there is no structural diminution, and the hard protective coating where applied remains efficient.

- 15 - 2.6.3 Provisions for extended measurements for areas with substantial corrosion as defined in 1.2.9 are given in annex 10 and may be additionally specified in the survey programme as required in 5.1. These extended thickness measurements should be carried out before the survey is credited as completed. Suspect areas identified at previous surveys should be examined. Areas of substantial corrosion identified at previous surveys should have thickness measurements taken. 2.6.4 The surveyor may further extend the thickness measurements as deemed necessary. 2.6.5 For areas in tanks where hard protective coatings are found to be in GOOD condition as defined in 1.2.11, the extent of thickness measurements according to annex 2 may be specially considered by the Administration. 2.6.6 Transverse sections should be chosen where the largest reductions are suspected to occur or are revealed from deck plating measurements. 2.7 Extent of tank pressure testing 2.7.1 All boundaries of water ballast tanks, deep tanks and cargo holds used for water ballast within the cargo length area should be pressure tested. For fuel oil tanks, only representative tanks should be pressure tested. 2.7.2 The surveyor may extend the tank testing as deemed necessary. 2.7.3 Boundaries of ballast tanks should be tested with a head of liquid to the top of air pipes. 2.7.4 Boundaries of ballast holds should be tested with a head of liquid to near the top of hatches. 2.7.5 Boundaries of fuel oil tanks should be tested with a head of liquid to the highest point that liquid will rise under service conditions. Tank testing of fuel oil tanks may be specially considered based on a satisfactory external examination of the tank boundaries and a confirmation from the master stating that the pressure testing has been carried out according to the requirements with satisfactory results. 2.7.6 The testing of double-bottom tanks and other spaces not designed for the carriage of liquid may be omitted, provided a satisfactory internal examination together with an examination of the tanktop is carried out. 2.8 Additional renewal survey requirements after determining compliance with regulations XII/12 and XII/13 of the Convention 2.8.1 For ships complying with the requirements of regulation XII/12 of the Convention for hold, ballast and dry space water level detectors, the renewal survey should include an examination and a test of the water ingress detection system and of their alarms. 2.8.2 For ships complying with the requirements of regulation XII/13 of the Convention for the availability of pumping systems, the renewal survey should include an examination and a test of the means for draining and pumping ballast tanks forward of the collision bulkhead and bilges of dry spaces any part of which extends forward of the foremost cargo hold, and of their controls.

- 16 - 3 Annual survey 3.1 General The annual survey should consist of an examination for the purpose of ensuring, as far as practicable, that the hull, weather decks, hatch covers, coamings and piping are maintained in a satisfactory condition and should take into account the service history, condition and extent of the corrosion prevention system of ballast tanks and areas identified in the survey report file. 3.2 Examination of the hull 3.2.1 Examination of the hull plating and its closing appliances should be carried out as far as can be seen. 3.2.2 Examination of watertight penetrations should be carried out as far as practicable. 3.3 Examination of weather decks, hatch covers and coamings 3.3.1 It should be confirmed that no unapproved changes have been made to the hatch covers, hatch coamings and their securing and sealing devices since the last survey. 3.3.2 A thorough survey of cargo hatch covers and coamings is only possible by examination in the open as well as closed positions and should include verification of proper opening and closing operation. As a result, at least the hatch covers sets within the forward 25% of the ship's length and at least one additional set, such that all the sets on the ship are assessed at least once in every five-year period, should be surveyed open, closed and in operation to the full extent in each direction at each annual survey, including: .1 stowage and securing in open condition; .2 proper fit and efficiency of sealing in closed condition; and .3 operational testing of hydraulic and power components, wires, chains and link drives. The closing of the covers should include the fastening of all peripheral, and cross joint cleats or other securing devices. Particular attention should be paid to the condition of hatch covers in the forward 25% of the ship's length, where sea loads are normally greatest. 3.3.3 If there are indications of difficulty in operating and securing hatch covers, additional sets above those required by 3.3.2, at the discretion of the surveyor, should be tested in operation. 3.3.4 Where the cargo hatch securing system does not function properly, repairs should be carried out under the supervision of the Administration. Where hatch covers or coamings undergo substantial repairs, the strength of securing devices should be upgraded to comply with annex 13. 3.3.5 For each cargo hatch cover set, at each annual survey, the following items should be surveyed: .1 cover panels, including side plates, and stiffener attachments that may be accessible in the open position by close-up survey (for corrosion, cracks, deformation); RESOLUTION A.1049(27) adopted on 30 November 2011 INTERNATIONAL CODE ON THE ENHANCED PROGRAMME OF INSPECTIONS DURING SURVEYS OF BULK CARRIERS AND OIL TANKERS, 2001 (2011 ESP CODE)

- 17 - .2 sealing arrangements of perimeter and cross joints (gaskets for condition and permanent deformation, flexible seals on combination carriers, gasket lips, compression bars, drainage channels and non-return valves); .3 clamping devices, retaining bars, cleating (for wastage, adjustment, and condition of rubber components); .4 closed cover locating devices (for distortion and attachment); .5 chain or rope pulleys; .6 guides; .7 guiderails and track wheels; .8 stoppers; .9 wires, chains, tensioners and gypsies; .10 hydraulic system, electrical safety devices and interlocks; and .11 end and interpanel hinges, pins and stools where fitted. 3.3.6 At each hatchway, at each annual survey, the coamings, with plating, stiffeners and brackets should be checked for corrosion, cracks and deformation, especially of the coaming tops including close-up survey. 3.3.7 Where considered necessary, the effectiveness of sealing arrangements may be proved by hose or chalk testing supplemented by dimensional measurements of seal compressing components. 3.3.8 Where portable covers, wooden or steel pontoons are fitted, the satisfactory condition of the following should be confirmed, where applicable: .1 wooden covers and portable beams, carriers or sockets for the portable beam, and their securing devices; .2 steel pontoons, including close-up survey of hatch cover plating; .3 tarpaulins; .4 cleats, battens and wedges; .5 hatch securing bars and their securing devices; .6 loading pads/bars and the side plate edge; .7 guideplates and chocks; and .8 compression bars, drainage channels and drain pipes (if any). 3.3.9 The flame screens on vents to all bunker tanks should be examined. 3.3.10 Bunker and vent piping systems, including ventilators should be examined.

- 20 - 4 Intermediate survey 4.1 General 4.1.1 Items that are additional to the requirements of the annual survey may be surveyed either at the second or third annual survey or between these surveys. 4.1.2 The extent of survey is dependent upon the age of the ship as specified in 4.2, 4.3 and 4.4. 4.1.3 Concurrent crediting to both intermediate survey and renewal survey for surveys and thickness measurements of space should not be acceptable. 4.2 Bulk carriers 5 to 10 years of age 4.2.1 Ballast tanks 4.2.1.1 For tanks used for water ballast, an overall survey of representative tanks selected by the surveyor should be carried out. The selection should include fore and aft peak tanks and a number of other tanks, taking into account the total number and type of ballast tanks. If such overall survey reveals no visible structural defects, the examination may be limited to verification that the corrosion prevention system remains efficient. 4.2.1.2 Where POOR coating condition, corrosion or other defects are found in water ballast tanks or where hard protective coating was not applied from the time of construction, the examination should be extended to other ballast tanks of the same type. 4.2.1.3 In ballast tanks other than double-bottom tanks, where a hard protective coating is found in POOR condition and it is not renewed, or where soft or semi-hard coating has been applied, or where a hard protective coating was not applied from the time of construction, the tanks in question should be examined and thickness measurements carried out as considered necessary at annual intervals. When such breakdown of coating is found in ballast double- bottom tanks, where a soft or semi-hard coating has been applied, or where a hard protective coating has not been applied, the tanks in question may be examined at annual intervals. When considered necessary by the surveyor, or where extensive corrosion exists, thickness measurements should be carried out. 4.2.1.4 In addition to the requirements above, suspect areas identified at previous renewal surveys should be overall and close-up surveyed. 4.2.2 Cargo holds 4.2.2.1 An overall survey of all cargo holds, including close-up survey of sufficient extent, minimum 25% of frames, should be carried out to establish the condition of: .1 shell frames including their upper and lower end attachments, adjacent shell plating, and transverse bulkheads in the forward cargo hold and one other selected cargo hold; and .2 areas found to be suspect areas at previous surveys. 4.2.2.2 Where considered necessary by the surveyor as a result of the overall and close-up survey as described in 4.2.2.1, the survey should be extended to include a close-up survey of all of the shell frames and adjacent shell plating of that cargo hold as well as a close-up survey of sufficient extent of all remaining cargo holds.

The minimum requirement for thickness measurements at the intermediate survey are areas found to be suspect areas at previous surveys. 4.2.3.2 The extent of thickness measurement may be specially considered provided the surveyor is satisfied by the close-up survey, that there is no structural diminution and the hard protective coatings are found to be in a GOOD condition. 4.2.3.3 Where substantial corrosion is found, the extent of thickness measurements should be increased in accordance with the requirements of annex 10. These extended thickness measurements should be carried out before the survey is credited as completed. Suspect areas identified at previous surveys should be examined. Areas of substantial corrosion identified at previous surveys should have thickness measurements taken. 4.3 Bulk carriers 10 to 15 years of age 4.3.1 The requirements of the intermediate survey should be the same extent as the previous renewal survey as required in 2 and 5.1. However, internal examination of fuel tanks and pressure testing of all tanks are not required unless deemed necessary by the attending surveyor. 4.3.2 In application of 4.3.1, the intermediate survey may be commenced at the second annual survey and be progressed during the succeeding year with a view to completion at the third annual survey in lieu of the application of 2.1.1. 4.3.3 In application of 4.3.1, an underwater survey may be considered in lieu of the requirements of 2.2. 4.4 Bulk carriers exceeding 15 years of age 4.4.1 The requirements of the intermediate survey should be to the same extent as the previous renewal survey required in 2 and 5.1. However, internal examination of fuel tanks and pressure testing of all tanks are not required unless deemed necessary by the attending surveyor. 4.4.2 In application of 4.4.1, the intermediate survey may be commenced at the second annual survey and be progressed during the succeeding year with a view to completion at the third annual survey in lieu of the application of 2.1.1. 4.4.3 In application of 4.4.1, a survey in dry-dock should be part of the intermediate survey. The overall and close-up surveys and thickness measurements, as applicable, of the lower portions of the cargo holds and water ballast tanks should be carried out in accordance with the applicable requirements for intermediate surveys, if not already performed. Note: Lower portions of the cargo holds and ballast tanks are considered to be the parts below light ballast water line.

- 22 - 5 Preparations for survey 5.1 Survey programme 5.1.1 The owner in cooperation with the Administration should work out a specific survey programme prior to the commencement of any part of: .1 the renewal survey; and .2 the intermediate survey for bulk carriers over 10 years of age. The survey programme should be in a written format based on the information in annex 4A. The survey should not commence until the survey programme has been agreed. 5.1.1.1 Prior to the development of the survey programme, the survey planning questionnaire should be completed by the owner based on the information set out in annex 4B, and forwarded to the Administration. 5.1.1.2 The survey programme at intermediate survey may consist of the survey programme at the previous renewal survey supplemented by the condition evaluation report of that renewal survey and later relevant survey reports. The survey programme should be worked out taking into account any amendments to the survey requirements after the last renewal survey carried out. 5.1.2 In developing the survey programme, the following documentation should be collected and consulted with a view to selecting tanks, holds, areas and structural elements to be examined: .1 survey status and basic ship information; .2 documentation on board, as described in 6.2 and 6.3; .3 main structural plans (scantlings drawings), including information regarding use of high-tensile steels (HTS); .4 relevant previous survey and inspection reports from both the classification society and the owner; .5 information regarding the use of ship's holds and tanks, typical cargoes and other relevant data; .6 information regarding corrosion prevention level on the new building; and .7 information regarding the relevant maintenance level during operation. 5.1.3 The submitted survey programme should account for and comply, as a minimum, with the requirements of 2.7 and annexes 1 and 2 for close-up survey, thickness measurement and tank testing, respectively, and is to include relevant information including at least: .1 basic ship information and particulars; .2 main structural plans (scantling drawings), including information regarding use of high-tensile steels (HTS); .3 plan of holds and tanks; RESOLUTION A.1049(27) adopted on 30 November 2011 INTERNATIONAL CODE ON THE ENHANCED PROGRAMME OF INSPECTIONS DURING SURVEYS OF BULK CARRIERS AND OIL TANKERS, 2001 (2011 ESP CODE)

These Guidelines are a recommended tool which may be invoked at the discretion of the Administration, when considered necessary and appropriate, in conjunction with the preparation of the required survey programme. 5.2 Conditions for survey 5.2.1 The owner should provide the necessary facilities for a safe execution of the survey. 5.2.2 In order to enable the attending surveyors to carry out the survey, provisions for proper and safe access should be agreed between the owner and the Administration. 5.2.3 Details of the means of access should be provided in the survey planning questionnaire. 5.2.4 In cases where the provisions of safety and required access are judged by the attending surveyor(s) not to be adequate, the survey of the spaces involved should not proceed. 5.2.5 Cargo holds, tanks and spaces should be safe for access. Cargo holds, tanks and spaces should be gas free and properly ventilated. Prior to entering a tank, void or enclosed space, it should be verified that the atmosphere in the tank is free from hazardous gas and contains sufficient oxygen. 5.2.6 In preparation for survey and thickness measurements and to allow for a thorough examination, all spaces should be cleaned including removal from surfaces of all loose accumulated corrosion scale. Spaces should be sufficiently clean and free from water, scale, dirt, oil residues, etc., to reveal corrosion, deformation, fractures, damages or other structural deterioration as well as the condition of the coating. However, those areas of structure whose renewal has already been decided by the owner need only be cleaned and descaled to the extent necessary to determine the limits of the areas to be renewed. 5.2.7 Sufficient illumination should be provided to reveal corrosion, deformation, fractures, damages or other structural deterioration as well as the condition of the coating.

A safety checklist should be provided. 5.4.4 Adequate and safe lighting should be provided for the safe and efficient conduct of the survey. 5.4.5 Adequate protective clothing should be made available and used (e.g. safety helmet, gloves, safety shoes, etc.) during the survey. 5.5 Surveys at sea or at anchorage 5.5.1 Surveys at sea or at anchorage may be accepted provided the surveyor is given the necessary assistance from the personnel on board. Necessary precautions and procedures for carrying out the survey should be in accordance with 5.1, 5.2, 5.3 and 5.4. 5.5.2 A communication system should be arranged between the survey party in the spaces and the responsible officer on deck. This system should also include the personnel in charge of ballast pump handling if boats or rafts are used. 5.5.3 Surveys of tanks or applicable holds by means of boats or rafts should only be undertaken with the agreement of the surveyor, who should take into account the safety arrangements provided, including weather forecasting and ship response under foreseeable conditions and provided the expected rise of water within the tank does not exceed 0.25 m. 5.5.4 When rafts or boats will be used for close-up survey the following conditions should be observed: .1 only rough duty, inflatable rafts or boats, having satisfactory residual buoyancy and stability even if one chamber is ruptured, should be used; .2 the boat or raft should be tethered to the access ladder and an additional person should be stationed down the access ladder with a clear view of the boat or raft; .3 appropriate lifejackets should be available for all participants; .4 the surface of water in the tank or hold should be calm (under all foreseeable conditions the expected rise of water within the tank should not exceed 0.25 m) and the water level stationary. On no account should the level of the water be rising while the boat or raft is in use; .5 the tank, hold or space must contain clean ballast water only. Even a thin sheen of oil on the water is not acceptable; and .6 at no time should the water level be allowed to be within 1 m of the deepest under deck web face flat so that the survey team is not isolated from a direct escape route to the tank hatch. Filling to levels above the deck transverses should only be contemplated if a deck access manhole is fitted and open in the bay being examined, so that an escape route for the survey party is available at all times. Other effective means of escape to the deck may be considered.

- 27 - 5.5.5 Rafts or boats alone may be allowed for inspection of the under deck areas for tanks or spaces, if the depth of the webs is 1.5 m or less. 5.5.6 If the depth of the webs is more than 1.5 m, rafts or boats alone may be allowed only: .1 when the coating of the under-deck structure is in GOOD condition and there is no evidence of wastage; or .2 if a permanent means of access is provided in each bay to allow safe entry and exit. This means: .1 access direct from the deck via a vertical ladder and a small platform fitted approximately 2 m below the deck in each bay; or .2 access to deck from a longitudinal permanent platform having ladders to deck in each end of the tank. The platform should, for the full length of the tank, be arranged in level with, or above, the maximum water level needed for rafting of under deck structure. For this purpose, the ullage corresponding to the maximum water level should be assumed not more than 3 m from the deck plate measured at the midspan of deck transverses and the middle length of the tank. If neither of the above conditions are met, then staging or other equivalent means should be provided for the survey of the under-deck areas. 5.5.7 The use of rafts or boats alone in 5.5.5 and 5.5.6 does not preclude the use of boats or rafts to move about within a tank during a survey. 5.6 Survey planning meeting 5.6.1 The establishment of proper preparation and the close cooperation between the attending surveyor(s) and the owner's representatives on board prior to and during the survey are an essential part in the safe and efficient conduct of the survey. During the survey on board safety meetings should be held regularly. 5.6.2 Prior to commencement of any part of the renewal and intermediate survey, a survey planning meeting should be held between the attending surveyor(s), the owner's representative in attendance, the thickness measurement company operator (as applicable) and the master of the ship or an appropriately qualified representative appointed by the master or company for the purpose to ascertain that all the arrangements envisaged in the survey programme are in place, so as to ensure the safe and efficient conduct of the survey work to be carried out (see also 7.1.2). 5.6.3 The following is an indicative list of items that should be addressed in the meeting: .1 schedule of the vessel (i.e. the voyage, docking and undocking manoeuvres, periods alongside, cargo and ballast operations, etc.); .2 provisions and arrangements for thickness measurements (i.e. access, cleaning/descaling, illumination, ventilation, personal safety); .3 extent of the thickness measurements; .4 acceptance criteria (refer to the list of minimum thicknesses); RESOLUTION A.1049(27) adopted on 30 November 2011 INTERNATIONAL CODE ON THE ENHANCED PROGRAMME OF INSPECTIONS DURING SURVEYS OF BULK CARRIERS AND OIL TANKERS, 2001 (2011 ESP CODE)

- 46 - ANNEX 6 SURVEY REPORTING PRINCIPLES As a principle, for bulk carriers subject to the Code, the surveyor should include the following contents in his report for survey of hull structure and piping systems, as relevant for the survey. 1 General 1.1 A survey report should be generated in the following cases: .1 in connection with commencement, continuation and/or completion of periodical hull surveys, i.e. annual, intermediate and renewal surveys, as relevant; .2 when structural damages/defects have been found; .3 when repairs, renewals or modifications have been carried out; and .4 when condition of class (recommendation) has been imposed or has been deleted. 1.2 The reporting should provide: .1 evidence that prescribed surveys have been carried out in accordance with applicable requirements; .2 documentation of surveys carried out with findings, repairs carried out and condition of class (recommendation) imposed or deleted; .3 survey records, including actions taken, which should form an auditable documentary trail. Survey reports should be kept in the survey report file required to be on board; .4 information for planning of future surveys; and .5 information which may be used as input for maintenance of classification rules and instructions. 1.3 When a survey is split between different survey stations, a report should be made for each portion of the survey. A list of items surveyed, relevant findings and an indication of whether the item has been credited, are to be made available to the next attending surveyor, prior to continuing or completing the survey. Thickness measurement and tank testing carried out is also to be listed for the next surveyor. 2 Extent of the survey 2.1 Identification of compartments where an overall survey has been carried out. 2.2 Identification of locations, in each ballast tank and cargo hold including hatch covers and coamings, where a close-up survey has been carried out, together with information on the means of access used. RESOLUTION A.1049(27) adopted on 30 November 2011 INTERNATIONAL CODE ON THE ENHANCED PROGRAMME OF INSPECTIONS DURING SURVEYS OF BULK CARRIERS AND OIL TANKERS, 2001 (2011 ESP CODE)

- 47 - 2.3 Identification of locations, in each ballast tank and cargo hold including hatch covers and coamings, where thickness measurement has been carried out. Note: As a minimum, the identification of location of close-up survey and thickness measurement should include a confirmation, with description of individual structural members, corresponding to the extent of requirements stipulated in annex A based on type of periodical survey and the ship's age. Where only partial survey is required, i.e. 25% of shell frames, one transverse web, two selected cargo hold transverse bulkheads, the identification should include location within each ballast tank and cargo hold by reference to frame numbers. 2.4 For areas in ballast tanks and cargo holds where protective coating is found to be in good condition and the extent of close-up survey and/or thickness measurement has been specially considered, structures subject to special consideration should be identified. 2.5 Identification of tanks subject to tank testing. 2.6 Identification of piping systems on deck and within cargo holds, ballast tanks, pipe tunnels, cofferdams and void spaces where: .1 examination including internal examination of piping with valves and fittings and thickness measurement, as relevant, has been carried out; and .2 operational test to working pressure has been carried out. 3 Result of the survey 3.1 Type, extent and condition of protective coating in each tank, as relevant (rated GOOD, FAIR or POOR) including identification of tanks fitted with anodes. 3.2 Structural condition of each compartment with information on the following, as relevant: .1 identification of findings, such as: .1 corrosion with description of location, type and extent; .2 areas with substantial corrosion; .3 cracks/fractures with description of location and extent; .4 buckling with description of location and extent; and .5 indents with description of location and extent; .2 identification of compartments where no structural damages/defects are found. The report may be supplemented by sketches/photos; and .3 thickness measurement report should be verified and signed by the surveyor controlling the measurements on board.

- 75 - ANNEX 9 GUIDELINES FOR TECHNICAL ASSESSMENT IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE PLANNING OF ENHANCED SURVEYS FOR BULK CARRIERS – RENEWAL SURVEY HULL 1 Introduction These Guidelines contain information and suggestions concerning technical assessments which may be of use in conjunction with the planning of enhanced renewal surveys of bulk carriers. As indicated in 5.1.5, the Guidelines are a recommended tool which may be invoked at the discretion of an Administration, when considered necessary and appropriate, in conjunction with the preparation of the required survey programme. 2 Purpose and principles 2.1 Purpose The purpose of the technical assessments described in these Guidelines is to assist in identifying critical structural areas, nominating suspect areas and in focusing attention on structural elements or areas of structural elements which may be particularly susceptible to, or evidence a history of, wastage or damage. This information may be useful in nominating locations, areas, holds and tanks for thickness measurement, close-up survey and tank testing. Critical structural areas are locations which have been identified from calculations to require monitoring or from the service history of the subject ship or from similar or sister ships (if available) to be sensitive to cracking, buckling or corrosion which would impair the structural integrity of the ship. 2.2 Minimum requirements These Guidelines may not be used to reduce the requirements of annexes 1 and 2 and paragraph 2.7 of part A for close-up survey, thickness measurement and tank testing, respectively, which are, in all cases, to be complied with as a minimum. 2.3 Timing As with other aspects of survey planning, the technical assessments described in these Guidelines should be completed by the owner or operator in cooperation with the Administration well in advance of the commencement of the renewal survey, i.e. prior to commencing the survey and normally at least 12 to 15 months before the survey's completion due date. 2.4 Aspects to be considered 2.4.1 Technical assessments, which may include quantitative or qualitative evaluation of relative risks of possible deterioration, of the following aspects of a particular ship may be used as a basis for the nomination of holds, tanks and areas for survey: .1 design features such as stress levels on various structural elements, design details and extent of use of high-tensile steel; .2 former history with respect to corrosion, cracking, buckling, indents and repairs for the particular ship as well as similar vessels, where available; and RESOLUTION A.1049(27) adopted on 30 November 2011 INTERNATIONAL CODE ON THE ENHANCED PROGRAMME OF INSPECTIONS DURING SURVEYS OF BULK CARRIERS AND OIL TANKERS, 2001 (2011 ESP CODE)

- 76 - .3 information with respect to types of cargo carried, protection of tanks, and condition of coating, if any, of holds and tanks. 2.4.2 Technical assessments of the relative risks of susceptibility to damage or deterioration of various structural elements and areas should be judged and decided on the basis of recognized principles and practices, such as may be found in reference 3. 3 Technical assessment 3.1 General 3.1.1 There are three basic types of possible failure which may be the subject of technical assessment in connection with planning of surveys: corrosion, cracks and buckling. Contact damages are not normally covered by the survey plan since indents are usually noted in memoranda and assumed to be dealt with as a normal routine by surveyors. 3.1.2 Technical assessments performed in conjunction with the survey planning process should, in principle, be as shown schematically in figure 1 which depicts, schematically, how technical assessments can be carried out in conjunction with the survey planning process. The approach is based on an evaluation of experience and knowledge basically related to: .1 design; and .2 corrosion. 3.1.3 The design should be considered with respect to structural details which may be susceptible to buckling or cracking as a result of vibration, high stress levels or fatigue. 3.1.4 Corrosion is related to the ageing process, and is closely connected with the quality of corrosion protection at new building, and subsequent maintenance during the service life. Corrosion may also lead to cracking and/or buckling. 3.2 Methods 3.2.1 Design details 3.2.1.1 Damage experience related to the ship in question and similar ships, where available, is the main source of information to be used in the process of planning. In addition, a selection of structural details from the design drawings should be included. 3.2.1.2 Typical damage experience to be considered will consist of: .1 number, extent, location and frequency of cracks; and .2 location of buckles. 3.2.1.3 This information may be found in the survey reports and/or the owner's files, including the results of the owner's own inspections. The defects should be analysed, noted and marked on sketches. 3.2.1.4 In addition, general experience should be utilized. For example, figure 2 shows typical locations in bulk carriers which experience has shown may be susceptible to structural damage. Also, reference should be made to reference 3 which contains a catalogue of typical damages and proposed repair methods for various bulk carrier structural details. RESOLUTION A.1049(27) adopted on 30 November 2011 INTERNATIONAL CODE ON THE ENHANCED PROGRAMME OF INSPECTIONS DURING SURVEYS OF BULK CARRIERS AND OIL TANKERS, 2001 (2011 ESP CODE)

- 77 - 3.2.1.5 Such figures should be used together with a review of the main drawings, in order to compare with the actual structure and search for similar details which may be susceptible to damage. An example is shown in figure 3. 3.2.1.6 The review of the main structural drawings, in addition to using the above-mentioned figures, should include checking typical design details where cracking has been experienced. The factors contributing to damage should be carefully considered. 3.2.1.7 The use of high-tensile steel (HTS) is an important factor. Details showing good service experience where ordinary, mild steel has been used may be more susceptible to damage when HTS, and its higher associated stresses, are utilized. There is extensive and, in general, good experience with the use of HTS for longitudinal material in deck and bottom structures. Experience in other locations, where the dynamic stresses may be higher, is less favourable, e.g. side structures. 3.2.1.8 In this respect, stress calculations of typical and important components and details, in accordance with relevant methods, may prove useful and should be considered. 3.2.1.9 The selected areas of the structure identified during this process should be recorded and marked on the structural drawings to be included in the survey programme. 3.2.2 Corrosion 3.2.2.1 In order to evaluate relative corrosion risks, the following information is generally to be considered: .1 usage of tanks, holds and spaces; .2 condition of coatings; .3 cleaning procedures; .4 previous corrosion damage; .5 ballast use and time for cargo holds; .6 risk of corrosion in cargo holds and ballast tanks; and .7 location of ballast tanks adjacent to heated fuel oil tanks. 3.2.2.2 Reference 2 gives definitive examples which can be used for judging and describing coating condition, using typical pictures of conditions. 3.2.2.3 For bulk carriers, reference 3 should be used as the basis for the evaluation, together with the age of the ship and relevant information on the anticipated condition of the ship as derived from the information collected in order to prepare the survey programme. 3.2.2.4 The various tanks, holds and spaces should be listed with the corrosion risks nominated accordingly. 3.2.3 Locations for close-up survey and thickness measurement 3.2.3.1 On the basis of the table of corrosion risks and the evaluation of design experience, the locations for initial close-up survey and thickness measurement (sections) may be nominated. RESOLUTION A.1049(27) adopted on 30 November 2011 INTERNATIONAL CODE ON THE ENHANCED PROGRAMME OF INSPECTIONS DURING SURVEYS OF BULK CARRIERS AND OIL TANKERS, 2001 (2011 ESP CODE)

- 78 - 3.2.3.2 The sections subject to thickness measurement should normally be nominated in tanks, holds and spaces where corrosion risk is judged to be the highest. 3.2.3.3 The nomination of tanks, holds and spaces for close-up survey should, initially, be based on highest corrosion risk, and should always include ballast tanks. The principle for the selection should be that the extent is increased by age or where information is insufficient or unreliable.

- 85 - ANNEX 11 GUIDELINES FOR THE GAUGING OF THE VERTICALLY CORRUGATED TRANSVERSE WATERTIGHT BULKHEAD BETWEEN HOLDS NOS. 1 AND 2 1 Gauging is necessary to determine the general condition of the structure and to define the extent of possible repairs and/or reinforcements of the vertically corrugated transverse watertight bulkhead for verification of the compliance with the bulk carrier bulkhead and double-bottom strength standards, defined in regulation XII/1.7 of the Convention. 2 Taking into account the buckling model specified in the bulk carrier bulkhead and double-bottom strength standards, defined in regulation XII/1.7 of the Convention, in the evaluation of strength of the bulkhead, it is essential to determine the thickness diminution at the critical levels shown in figures 1 and 2 of this annex. 3 The gauging should be carried out at the levels as described below. To adequately assess the scantlings of each individual vertical corrugation, each corrugation flange, web, shedder plate and gusset plate within each of the levels given below should be gauged. Level (a) Ships without lower stool (see figure 1): Locations: - The mid-breadth of the corrugation flanges at approximately 200 mm above the line of shedder plates; - The middle of gusset plates between corrugation flanges, where fitted; - The middle of the shedder plates; - The mid-breadth of the corrugation webs at approximately 200 mm above the line of shedder plates. Level (b) Ships with lower stool (see figure 2): Locations: - The mid-breadth of the corrugation flanges at approximately 200 mm above the line of shedder plates; - The middle of gusset plates between corrugation flanges, where fitted; - The middle of the shedder plates; - The mid-breadth of the corrugation webs at approximately 200 mm above the line of shedder plates. Level (c) Ships with or without lower stool (see figures 1 and 2): Locations: - The mid-breadth of the corrugation flanges and webs at about the mid-height of the corrugation. 4 Where the thickness changes within the horizontal levels, the thinner plate should be gauged. 5 Steel renewal and/or reinforcement should comply with the bulk carrier bulkhead and double-bottom strength standards, defined in regulation XII/1.7 of the Convention.

- 87 - ANNEX 12 ADDITIONAL ANNUAL SURVEY REQUIREMENTS FOR THE FOREMOST CARGO HOLD OF SHIPS SUBJECT TO REGULATION XII/9 OF THE CONVENTION 1 General In the case of bulk carriers over five years of age, the annual survey should include, in addition to the requirements of the annual surveys prescribed in chapter 3 of the present Code, an examination of the following items. 2 Extent of survey 2.1 For bulk carriers of 5 to 15 years of age 2.1.1 An overall survey of the foremost cargo hold, including close-up survey of sufficient extent, minimum 25% of frames, should be carried out to establish the condition of: .1 shell frames including their upper and lower end attachments, adjacent shell plating, and transverse bulkheads; and .2 areas found to be suspect areas at the previous renewal survey. 2.1.2 Where considered necessary by the surveyor as a result of the overall and close-up survey as described in 2.1.1 above, the survey should be extended to include a close-up survey of all of the shell frames and adjacent shell plating of the cargo hold. 2.2 For bulk carriers exceeding 15 years of age An overall survey of the foremost cargo hold, including close-up survey should be carried out to establish the condition of: .1 all shell frames including their upper and lower end attachments, adjacent shell plating, and transverse bulkheads; and .2 areas found to be suspect areas at the previous renewal survey. 3 Extent of thickness measurement 3.1 Thickness measurement should be carried out to an extent sufficient to determine both general and local corrosion levels at areas subject to close-up survey, as described in 2.1 and 2.2 above. The minimum requirement for thickness measurements are areas found to be suspect areas at the previous renewal survey. Where substantial corrosion is found, the extent of thickness measurements should be increased with the requirements of annex 10. 3.2 The thickness measurement may be dispensed with provided the surveyor is satisfied by the close-up survey, there is no structural diminution and the protective coating, where applied, remains effective.

- 88 - 4 Special consideration Where the protective coating, as referred to in the explanatory note below, in the foremost cargo hold is found to be in GOOD condition, the extent of close-up surveys and thickness measurements may be specially considered. Explanatory note: For existing bulk carriers, where owners may elect to coat or recoat cargo holds as noted above, consideration may be given to the extent of the close-up and thickness measurement surveys. Prior to the coating of cargo holds of existing ships, scantlings should be ascertained in the presence of a surveyor.

Arrangement and spacing should be determined with due attention to the effectiveness for weathertightness, depending upon the type and the size of the hatch cover, as well as on the stiffness of the cover edges between the securing devices. .2 The net sectional area of each securing device should not be less than: A = 1.4 a / f (cm 2 ) where: a = spacing between securing devices not to be taken less than 2 m f = ( σ Y / 235) e σ Y = specified minimum upper yield stress in N/mm 2 of the steel used for fabrication, not to be taken greater than 70% of the ultimate tensile strength e = 0.75 for σ Y > 235 1.0 for σ Y ≤ 235. Rods or bolts should have a net diameter not less than 19 mm for hatchways exceeding 5 m 2 in area. .3 Between cover and coaming and at cross-joints, a packing line pressure sufficient to obtain weathertightness should be maintained by the securing devices. For packing line pressures exceeding 5 N/mm, the cross section area should be increased in direct proportion. The packing line pressure should be specified. .4 The cover edge stiffness should be sufficient to maintain adequate sealing pressure between securing devices. The moment of inertia, I , of edge elements should not be less than: I = 6 p a 4 (cm 4 ) where: p = packing line pressure in N/mm, minimum 5 N/mm a = spacing in metres of securing devices. .5 Securing devices should be of reliable construction and securely attached to the hatchway coamings, decks or covers. Individual securing devices on each cover are to have approximately the same stiffness characteristics.

- 91 - ANNEX 14 PROCEDURAL REQUIREMENTS FOR THICKNESS MEASUREMENTS 1 General Thickness measurements required in the context of hull structural surveys, if not carried out by the society itself, should be witnessed by a surveyor. The attendance of the surveyor should be recorded. This also applies to thickness measurements taken during voyages. 2 Survey meeting 2.1 Prior to commencement of the renewal or intermediate survey, a meeting should be held between the attending surveyor(s), the owner's representative(s) in attendance, the thickness measurement firm's representative(s) and the master of the ship or an appropriately qualified representative appointed by the master or Company so as to ensure the safe and efficient execution of the surveys and thickness measurements to be carried out on board. 2.2 Communication with the thickness measurement operator(s) and owner's representative(s) should be agreed during the meeting, with respect to the following: .1 reporting of thickness measurements on regular basis; and .2 prompt notification to the surveyor in case of findings such as: .1 excessive and/or extensive corrosion or pitting/grooving of any significance; .2 structural defects like buckling, fractures and deformed structures; .3 detached and/or holed structure; and .4 corrosion of welds. 2.3 The survey report should indicate where and when the meeting took place and who attended (the name of the surveyor(s), the owner's representative(s) and the thickness measurement firm's representative(s)). 3 Monitoring of the thickness measurement process on board 3.1 The surveyor should decide final extent and location of thickness measurements after overall survey of representative spaces on board. 3.2 In case the owner prefers to commence the thickness measurements prior to the overall survey, then the surveyor should advise that the planned extent and locations of thickness measurements are subject to confirmation during the overall survey. Based on findings, the surveyor may require additional thickness measurements to be taken. 3.3 The surveyor should direct the gauging operation by selecting locations such that readings taken represent, on average, the condition of the structure for that area. 3.4 Thickness measurements taken mainly to evaluate the extent of corrosion, which may affect the hull girder strength, should be carried out in a systematic manner such that all longitudinal structural members are gauged, as required. RESOLUTION A.1049(27) adopted on 30 November 2011 INTERNATIONAL CODE ON THE ENHANCED PROGRAMME OF INSPECTIONS DURING SURVEYS OF BULK CARRIERS AND OIL TANKERS, 2001 (2011 ESP CODE)

- 92 - 3.5 Where thickness measurements indicate substantial corrosion or wastage in excess of allowable diminution, the surveyor should direct locations for additional thickness measurements in order to delineate areas of substantial corrosion and to identify structural members for repairs/renewals. 3.6 Thickness measurements of structures in areas where close-up surveys are required should be carried out simultaneously with close-up survey. 4 Review and verification 4.1 Upon completion of the thickness measurements, the surveyor should confirm that no further gaugings are needed, or specify additional gaugings. 4.2 Where these guidelines allow the extent of thickness measurements to be reduced after special considerations by the surveyor, these special considerations should be reported, where appropriate. 4.3 In case thickness measurements are partly carried out, the extent of remaining thickness measurements should be reported for the use of the next surveyor.

- 93 - ANNEX 15 GUIDELINES FOR THE THICKNESS MEASUREMENTS OF SIDE SHELL FRAMES AND BRACKETS IN SINGLE-SIDE SKIN BULK CARRIERS REQUIRED TO COMPLY WITH RESOLUTION MSC.168(79) 1 General Thickness measurements should be conducted to determine the general condition of the structure and to define the extent of possible steel renewals or other measures for the webs and flanges of side shell frames and brackets for verification of the compliance with resolution MSC.168(79). 2 Zones of side shell frames and brackets 2.1 For the purpose of steel renewal, sand blasting and coating, four zones A, B, C and D are defined as shown in figure 1. 2.2 Zones A and B should be considered the most critical zones. Figure 1 – Zones of side shell frames and brackets 3 Pitting and grooving 3.1 Pits can grow in a variety of shapes, some of which should be ground before assessment. 3.2 Pitting corrosion may be found under coating blisters, which should be removed before inspection. RESOLUTION A.1049(27) adopted on 30 November 2011 INTERNATIONAL CODE ON THE ENHANCED PROGRAMME OF INSPECTIONS DURING SURVEYS OF BULK CARRIERS AND OIL TANKERS, 2001 (2011 ESP CODE)

- 94 - 3.3 To measure the remaining thickness of pits or grooving the normal ultrasonic transducer (generally 10 mm diameter) will not suffice. A miniature transducer (3 to 5 mm diameter) should be used. Alternatively the firm conducting the thickness measurement should use a pit gauge to measure the depth of the pits and grooving and calculate the remaining thickness. Assessment based upon area 3.4 This is the method specified in paragraph 2.5 of annex 2 to resolution MSC.168(79) and is based upon the intensity determined from figure 2 below. 5% scattered 20% scattered 10% scattered 25% scattered 15% scattered Figure 2 – Pitting intensity diagrams (from 5 to 25% intensity) 3.5 If pitting intensity is higher than 15% in an area (see figure 2), then thickness measurements should be taken to determine the extent of the pitting corrosion. The 15% is based upon pitting or grooving on only one side of the plate. 3.6 In cases where pitting is evident as defined above (exceeding 15%) then an area of 300 mm diameter or more (or, where this is impracticable on the frame flange or the side shell, hopper tank plating or topside tank plating attached to the side frame, an equivalent rectangular area), at the most pitted part, should be cleaned to bare metal, and the thickness measured in way of the five deepest pits within the cleaned area. The least thickness measured in way of any of these pits is to be taken as the thickness to be recorded. 3.7 The minimum acceptable remaining thickness in any pit or groove is equal to: .1 75% of the as built thickness, for pitting or grooving in the cargo hold side frame webs and flanges. .2 70% of the as built thickness, for pitting or grooving in the side shell, hopper tank and topside tank plating attached to the cargo hold side frame, over a width up to 30 mm from each side of it. RESOLUTION A.1049(27) adopted on 30 November 2011 INTERNATIONAL CODE ON THE ENHANCED PROGRAMME OF INSPECTIONS DURING SURVEYS OF BULK CARRIERS AND OIL TANKERS, 2001 (2011 ESP CODE)

- 95 - 4 Thickness measurement methodology 4.1 Numbers of side frames to be measured should be equivalent to those of the renewal survey or intermediate survey corresponding to the ship's age. Representative thickness measurements should be taken for each zone as specified below. 4.2 Special consideration to the extent of the thickness measurements may be given by the Administration or organization recognized by the Administration, if the structural members show no thickness diminution with respect to the as built thicknesses and the coating is found in "as new" condition (i.e. without breakdown or rusting). 4.3 Where thickness measurement readings close to the criteria are found, the number of hold frames to be measured should be increased. 4.4 If renewal or other measures according to resolution MSC.168(79) should be applied on individual frames in a hold, then all frames in that hold should have thickness measurements taken. 4.5 There is a variety of construction methods used for side shell frames in bulk carriers. Some have faceplates (T sections) on the side shell frames, some have flanged plates and some have bulb plates. The use of faceplates and flanged sections is considered similar for thickness measurement purposes in that both the web and faceplate or web and flange plate should be measured. If bulb plate has been used, then web of the bulb plate should be measured in the normal manner and the sectional modulus should be specially considered if required. Gaugings for Zones A, B and D Web plating 4.6 The pattern for thickness measurements in Zones A, B and D should be a five-point pattern. See figure 3. The five-point pattern should be over the depth of the web and the same area vertically. The thickness measurement report should reflect the average reading. Figure 3 – Typical five-point pattern on the web plate RESOLUTION A.1049(27) adopted on 30 November 2011 INTERNATIONAL CODE ON THE ENHANCED PROGRAMME OF INSPECTIONS DURING SURVEYS OF BULK CARRIERS AND OIL TANKERS, 2001 (2011 ESP CODE)

- 96 - Thickness measurements for Zone C Web plating 4.7 Depending on the condition of the web in way of Zone C, the web may be measured by taking three readings over the length of Zone C and averaging them. The average reading should be compared with the allowable thickness. If the web plating has general corrosion then this pattern should be expanded to a five-point pattern as noted above. Thickness measurements for section a) and b) (flanges and side shell plating) 4.8 Where the lower bracket length or depth does not meet the requirements in annex 1 to resolution MSC.168(79), thickness measurements should be taken at sections a) and b) to calculate the actual section modulus required in paragraph 3.4 of annex 2 to resolution MSC.168(79) (see figure 4). At least two readings on the flange/faceplate should be taken on each side of the frame (i.e. fore and aft) in way of section a) and section b).

- 97 - Part B CODE ON THE ENHANCED PROGRAMME OF INSPECTIONS DURING SURVEYS OF BULK CARRIERS HAVING DOUBLE-SIDE SKIN CONSTRUCTION 1 General 1.1 Application 1.1.1 The Code should apply to all self-propelled double-side skin bulk carriers of 500 gross tonnage and above. 1.1.2 The Code should apply to surveys of hull structure and piping systems in way of cargo holds, cofferdams, pipe tunnels, void spaces, fuel oil tanks within the cargo length area and all ballast tanks. 1.1.3 The Code contains the minimum extent of examination, thickness measurements and tank testing. The survey should be extended when substantial corrosion and/or structural defects are found and include additional close-up survey when necessary. 1.1.4 For bulk carriers with hybrid cargo hold arrangements, e.g. with some cargo holds of single-side skin and others of double-side skin, the requirements of part A of annex A apply to cargo holds of single-side skin. 1.1.5 The surveys should be carried out during the surveys prescribed by regulation I/10 of the Convention. 1.2 Definitions 1.2.1 Double-side skin bulk carrier is a ship which is constructed generally with single deck, topside tanks and hopper side tanks in cargo spaces, and is intended primarily to carry dry cargo in bulk including ore carriers and combination carriers, in which all cargo holds are bounded by a double-side skin (regardless of the width of the wing space). 1.2.2 Ballast tank is a tank which is used solely for salt water ballast or, where applicable, a space which is used for both cargo and salt water ballast will be treated as a ballast tank when substantial corrosion has been found in that space. A double-side tank should be considered, for survey purposes, as a separate tank even if it is in connection to either the topside tank or the hopper side tank. 1.2.3 Spaces are separate compartments including holds, tanks, cofferdams and void spaces bounding cargo holds, decks and the outer hull. 1.2.4 Overall survey is a survey intended to report on the overall condition of the hull structure and determine the extent of additional close-up surveys. 1.2.5 Close-up survey is a survey where the details of structural components are within the close visual inspection range of the surveyor, i.e. normally within reach of hand. 1.2.6 Transverse section is the cross section of the hull perpendicular to the ship's centerline and includes all longitudinal members such as plating, longitudinals and girders at the deck sides, bottom, inner bottom, hopper sides, inner sides, top wing inner sides and longitudinal bulkheads.

- 98 - 1.2.7 Representative spaces are those which are expected to reflect the condition of other spaces of similar type and service and with similar corrosion prevention systems. When selecting representative spaces, account should be taken of the service and repair history on board and identifiable critical structural areas and/or suspect areas. 1.2.8 Suspect areas are locations showing substantial corrosion and/or are considered by the surveyor to be prone to rapid wastage. 1.2.9 Substantial corrosion is an extent of corrosion such that assessment of corrosion pattern indicates a wastage in excess of 75% of allowable margins, but within acceptable limits. For ships built under the IACS Common Structural Rules, substantial corrosion is an extent of corrosion such that the assessment of the corrosion pattern indicates a gauged (or measured) thickness between t net + 0.5 mm and t net . 1.2.10 A corrosion prevention system is normally considered a full hard protective coating. Hard protective coating should usually be epoxy coating or equivalent. Other coating systems which are neither soft nor semi-hard coatings, may be considered acceptable as alternatives provided that they are applied and maintained in compliance with the manufacturer's specifications. 1.2.11 Coating condition is defined as follows: GOOD condition with only minor spot rusting; FAIR condition with local breakdown of coating at edges of stiffeners and weld connections and/or light rusting over 20% or more of areas under consideration, but less than as defined for POOR condition; POOR condition with general breakdown of coating over 20% or more of areas or hard scale at 10% or more of areas under consideration. 1.2.12 Critical structural areas are locations which have been identified from calculations to require monitoring or from the service history of the subject ship or from similar or sister ships (if applicable) to be sensitive to cracking, buckling or corrosion which would impair the structural integrity of the ship. 1.2.13 Cargo length area is that part of the ship which includes all cargo holds and adjacent areas including fuel tanks, cofferdams, ballast tanks and void spaces. 1.2.14 Intermediate survey is a survey carried out either at the second or third annual survey or between these surveys. 1.2.15 A prompt and thorough repair is a permanent repair completed at the time of survey to the satisfaction of the surveyor, therein removing the need for the imposition of any associated condition of classification or recommendation. 1.2.16 Convention means the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea, 1974, as amended. 1.2.17 Specially considered (in connection with close-up surveys and thickness measurements) means sufficient close-up inspection and thickness measurements are taken to confirm the actual average condition of the structure under the coating.

- 99 - 1.3 Repairs 1.3.1 Any damage in association with wastage over the allowable limits (including buckling, grooving, detachment or fracture), or extensive areas of wastage over the allowable limits, which affects or, in the opinion of the Administration, will affect the ship's structural, watertight or weathertight integrity, should be promptly and thoroughly (see 1.2.15) repaired. Areas which should be considered include: .1 side structure and side plating; .2 deck structure and deck plating; .3 bottom structure and bottom plating; .4 inner bottom structure and inner bottom plating; .5 inner side structure and inner side plating; .6 watertight or oiltight bulkheads; .7 hatch covers or hatch coamings; and .8 items in 3.3.10. For locations where adequate repair facilities are not available, the Administration may allow the ship to proceed directly to a repair facility. This may require discharging the cargo and/or temporary repairs for the intended voyage. 1.3.2 Additionally, when a survey results in the identification of corrosion or structural defects, either of which, in the opinion of the Administration, will impair the ship's fitness for continued service, remedial measures should be implemented before the ship continues in service. 1.4 Surveyors For bulk carriers of 20,000 tons deadweight and above, two surveyors should jointly carry out the first scheduled renewal survey after the bulk carrier passes 10 years of age (i.e. third renewal survey), and all subsequent renewal surveys and intermediate surveys. If the surveys are carried out by a recognized organization, the surveyors should be exclusively employed by such recognized organizations. 1.5 Thickness measurements and close-up surveys In any kind of survey, i.e. renewal, intermediate, annual or other surveys having the scope of the foregoing ones, thickness measurements of structures in areas where close-up surveys are required should be carried out simultaneously with close-up surveys. 2 Renewal survey 2.1 General 2.1.1 The renewal survey may be commenced at the fourth annual survey and be progressed during the succeeding year with a view to completion by the fifth anniversary date.

- 100 - 2.1.2 As part of the preparation for the renewal survey, the survey programme should be dealt with in advance of the survey. The thickness measurement should not be held before the fourth annual survey. 2.1.3 The survey should include, in addition to the requirements of the annual survey, examination, tests and checks of sufficient extent to ensure that the hull and related piping, as required in 2.1.5, is in satisfactory condition and is fit for its intended purpose for the new period of validity of the Cargo Ship Safety Construction Certificate, subject to proper maintenance and operation and to periodical surveys being carried out at the due dates. 2.1.4 All cargo holds, ballast tanks, including double-bottom and double-side tanks, pipe tunnels, cofferdams and void spaces bounding cargo holds, decks and outer hull should be examined, and this examination should be supplemented by thickness measurement and testing, as required by 2.6 and 2.7, to ensure that the structural integrity remains effective. The examination should be sufficient to discover substantial corrosion, significant deformation, fractures, damages or other structural deterioration that may be present. 2.1.5 All piping systems within the above spaces should be examined and operationally tested under working pressure to attending surveyor's satisfaction to ensure that tightness and condition remain satisfactory. 2.1.6 The survey extent of ballast tanks converted to void spaces should be specially considered in relation to the requirements for ballast tanks. 2.1.7 Concurrent crediting to both intermediate survey and renewal survey for surveys and thickness measurements of spaces should not be acceptable. 2.2 Dry-dock survey 2.2.1 A survey in dry-dock should be a part of the renewal survey. There should be a minimum of two inspections of the outside of the ship's bottom during the five-year period of the certificate. In all cases, the maximum interval between bottom inspections should not exceed 36 months. 2.2.2 For ships of 15 years of age and over, inspection of the outside of the ship's bottom should be carried out with the ship in dry-dock. For ships of less than 15 years of age, alternate inspections of the ship's bottom not conducted in conjunction with the renewal survey may be carried out with the ship afloat. Inspection of the ship afloat should only be carried out when the conditions are satisfactory and the proper equipment and suitably qualified staff is available. 2.2.3 If a survey in dry-dock is not completed in conjunction with the enhanced survey during renewal survey or if the 36-month maximum interval referred to in 2.2.1 is not complied with, the Cargo Ship Safety Construction Certificate should cease to be valid until a survey in dry-dock is completed. 2.2.4 The overall and close-up survey and thickness measurements, as applicable, of the lower portions of the cargo holds and ballast tanks should be carried out in accordance with the applicable requirements for renewal survey, if not already performed. Note: Lower portions of the cargo holds and ballast tanks are considered to be the parts below light ballast water line.

- 101 - 2.3 Space protection 2.3.1 Where provided, the condition of the corrosion prevention system of ballast tanks should be examined. For ballast tanks, excluding double-bottom tanks, where a hard protective coating is found in POOR condition as defined in 1.2.11, and it is not renewed, or where a soft or semi-hard coating has been applied, or where a hard protective coating has not been applied from the time of constructions, the tanks in question should be examined at annual intervals. Thickness measurements should be carried out as deemed necessary by the surveyor. When such breakdown of hard protective coating is found in water ballast double-bottom tanks and it is not renewed, or where a soft or semi-hard coating has been applied or where a hard protective coating has not been applied from the time of construction, the tanks in question may be examined at annual intervals. When considered necessary by the surveyor, or where extensive corrosion exists, thickness measurement should be carried out. 2.3.2 Where a hard protective coating is provided in cargo holds and is found in good condition, the extent of close-up surveys and thickness measurements may be specially considered. 2.4 Hatch covers and coamings The hatch covers and coamings should be surveyed as follows: 2.4.1 A thorough inspection of the items listed in 3.3 should be carried out, in addition to all hatch covers and coamings. 2.4.2 Checking of the satisfactory operation of all mechanically operated hatch covers should be made, including: .1 stowage and securing in open condition; .2 proper fit and efficiency of sealing in closed condition; and .3 operational testing of hydraulic and power components, wires, chains and link drives. 2.4.3 The effectiveness of sealing arrangements of all hatch covers by hose testing or equivalent should be checked. 2.4.4 Thickness measurement of the hatch cover and coaming plating and stiffeners should be carried out as given in annex 2. 2.5 Extent of overall and close-up surveys 2.5.1 An overall survey of all tanks and spaces should be carried out at the renewal survey. Fuel oil tanks in the cargo length area should be surveyed as follows: RESOLUTION A.1049(27) adopted on 30 November 2011 INTERNATIONAL CODE ON THE ENHANCED PROGRAMME OF INSPECTIONS DURING SURVEYS OF BULK CARRIERS AND OIL TANKERS, 2001 (2011 ESP CODE)

Peak tanks (all uses) should be examined internally at each renewal survey. 4. At renewal survey no.3 and subsequent renewal surveys, one deep tank for fuel oil in the cargo area should be included, if fitted. 2.5.2 The minimum requirements for close-up surveys at renewal surveys are given in annex 1, appendix 1 for double-side skin bulk carriers, excluding ore carriers, and in annex 1, appendix 2 for ore carriers respectively. 2.5.3 The surveyor may extend the close-up survey as deemed necessary taking into account the maintenance of the spaces under survey, the condition of the corrosion prevention system and where spaces have structural arrangements or details which have suffered defects in similar spaces or on similar ships according to available information. 2.5.4 For areas in spaces where hard protective coatings are found to be in a GOOD condition, the extent of close-up surveys according to annex 1 may be specially considered (refer also to 2.3.2). 2.6 Extent of thickness measurements 2.6.1 The minimum requirements for thickness measurements at the renewal survey are given in annex 2. 2.6.2 Representative thickness measurements to determine both general and local levels of corrosion in the transverse web frames in all water ballast tanks should be carried out. Thickness measurements should also be carried out to determine the corrosion levels on the transverse bulkhead plating. The extent of thickness measurements may be specially considered provided the surveyor is satisfied by the close-up examination that there is no structural diminution, and the hard protective coating where applied remains efficient. 2.6.3 Provisions for extended measurements for areas with substantial corrosion as defined in 1.2.9 are given in annex 10 and may be additionally specified in the survey programme as required by 5.1. These extended thickness measurements should be carried out before the survey is credited as completed. Suspect areas identified at previous surveys should be examined. Areas of substantial corrosion identified at previous surveys should have thickness measurements taken. 2.6.4 The surveyor may further extend the thickness measurements as deemed necessary. 2.6.5 For areas in tanks where hard protective coatings are found to be in GOOD condition as defined in 1.2.11, the extent of thickness measurements according to annex 2 may be specially considered by the Administration. 2.6.6 Transverse sections should be chosen where the largest reductions are suspected to occur or are revealed from deck plating measurements.

- 103 - 2.7 Extent of tank pressure testing 2.7.1 All boundaries of water ballast tanks, deep tanks and cargo holds used for water ballast within the cargo length area should be pressure tested. For fuel tanks, only representative tanks should be pressure tested. 2.7.2 The surveyor may extend the tank testing as deemed necessary. 2.7.3 Boundaries of ballast tanks should be tested with a head of liquid to the top of air pipes. 2.7.4 Boundaries of ballast holds should be tested with a head of liquid to near to the top of hatches. 2.7.5 Boundaries of fuel oil tanks should be tested with a head of liquid to the highest point that liquid will rise under service conditions. Tank testing of fuel oil tanks may be specially considered based on a satisfactory external examination of the tank boundaries and a confirmation from the master stating that the pressure testing has been carried out according to the requirements with satisfactory results. 2.7.6 The testing of double-bottom tanks and other spaces not designated for the carriage of liquid may be omitted, provided a satisfactory internal examination together with an examination of the tank top is carried out. 2.8 Additional renewal survey requirements after determining compliance with regulations XII/12 and XII/13 of the Convention 2.8.1 For ships complying with the requirements of regulation XII/12 of the Convention for hold, ballast and dry space water level detectors, the renewal survey should include an examination and a test of the water ingress detection system and of their alarms. 2.8.2 For ships complying with the requirements of regulation XII/13 of the Convention for the availability of pumping systems, the renewal survey should include an examination and a test of the means for draining and pumping ballast tanks forward of the collision bulkhead and bilges of dry spaces any part of which extends forward of the foremost cargo hold, and of their controls. 3 Annual survey 3.1 General The annual survey should consist of an examination for the purpose of ensuring, as far as practicable, that the hull weather decks, hatch covers, coamings and piping are maintained in a satisfactory condition and should take into account the service history, condition and extent of the corrosion prevention system of ballast tanks and areas identified in the survey report file. 3.2 Examination of the hull 3.2.1 Examination of the hull plating and its closing appliances should be carried out as far as can be seen. 3.2.2 Examination of watertight penetrations should be carried out as far as practicable.

These Guidelines are a recommended tool which may be invoked at the discretion of the Administration, when considered necessary and appropriate, in conjunction with the preparation of the required survey programme. 5.2 Conditions for survey 5.2.1 The owner should provide the necessary facilities for a safe execution of the survey. 5.2.2 In order to enable the attending surveyors to carry out the survey, provisions for proper and safe access, should be agreed between the owner and the Administration. 5.2.3 Details of the means of access should be provided in the survey planning questionnaire. 5.2.4 In cases where the provisions of safety and required access are judged by the attending surveyors not to be adequate, the survey of the spaces involved should not proceed. 5.2.5 Cargo holds, tanks and spaces should be safe for access. Cargo holds, tanks and spaces should be gas free and properly ventilated. Prior to entering a tank, void or enclosed space, it should be verified that the atmosphere in the tank is free from hazardous gas and contains sufficient oxygen. 5.2.6 In preparation for survey and thickness measurements and to allow for a thorough examination, all spaces should be cleaned including removal from surfaces of all loose accumulated corrosion scale. Spaces should be sufficiently clean and free from water, scale, dirt, oil residues, etc., to reveal corrosion, deformation, fractures, damages or other structural deterioration as well as the condition of the coating. However, those areas of structure whose renewal has already been decided by the owner need only be cleaned and descaled to the extent necessary to determine the limits of the areas to be renewed. 5.2.7 Sufficient illumination should be provided to reveal corrosion, deformation, fractures, damages or other structural deterioration as well as the condition of the coating. 5.2.8 Where soft or semi-hard coatings have been applied, safe access should be provided for the surveyor to verify the effectiveness of the coating and to carry out an assessment of the conditions of internal structures which may include spot removal of the coating. When safe access cannot be provided, the soft or semi-hard coating should be removed. 5.2.9 The surveyor(s) should always be accompanied by, at least, one responsible person, assigned by the owner, experienced in tank and enclosed spaces inspection. In addition, a back-up team of at least two experienced persons should be stationed at the hatch opening of the tank or space that is being surveyed. The back-up team should continuously observe the work in the tank or space and should keep life-saving and evacuation equipment ready for use. 5.2.10 A communication system should be arranged between the survey party in the cargo hold, tank or space being examined, the responsible officer on deck and, as the case may be, the navigation bridge. The communication arrangements should be maintained throughout the survey.

On no account should the level of the water be rising while the boat or raft is in use; .5 the tank, hold or space should contain clean ballast water only. Even a thin sheen of oil on the water is not acceptable; and .6 at no time should the water level be allowed to be within 1 m of the deepest under deck web face flat so that the survey team is not isolated from a direct escape route to the tank hatch. Filling to levels above the deck transverses should only be contemplated if a deck access manhole is fitted and open in the bay being examined, so that an escape route for the survey party is available at all times. Other effective means of escape to the deck may be considered. 5.5.5 Rafts or boats alone may be allowed for inspection of the under deck areas for tanks or spaces, if the depth of the webs is 1.5 m or less. 5.5.6 If the depth of the webs is more than 1.5 m, rafts or boats alone may be allowed only: .1 when the coating of the under deck structure is in GOOD condition and there is no evidence of wastage; or .2 if a permanent means of access is provided in each bay to allow safe entry and exit. This means: .1 access direct from the deck via a vertical ladder and a small platform fitted approximately 2 m below the deck in each bay; or .2 access to deck from a longitudinal permanent platform having ladders to deck in each end of the tank. The platform should, for the full length of the tank, be arranged in level with, or above, the maximum water level needed for rafting of under deck structure. For this purpose, the ullage corresponding to the maximum water level should be assumed not more than 3 m from the deck plate measured at the midspan of deck transverses and in the middle length of the tank.

- 134 - ANNEX 6 SURVEY REPORTING PRINCIPLES As a principle, for bulk carriers subject to the Code, the surveyor should include the following contents in his report for survey of hull structure and piping systems, as relevant for the survey. 1 General 1.1 A survey report should be generated in the following cases: .1 in connection with commencement, continuation and/or completion of periodical hull surveys, i.e. annual, intermediate and renewal surveys, as relevant; .2 when structural damages/defects have been found; .3 when repairs, renewals or modifications have been carried out; and .4 when condition of class (recommendation) has been imposed or has been deleted. 1.2 The reporting should provide: .1 evidence that prescribed surveys have been carried out in accordance with applicable requirements; .2 documentation of surveys carried out with findings, repairs carried out and condition of class (recommendation) imposed or deleted; .3 survey records, including actions taken, which should form an auditable documentary trail. Survey reports should be kept in the survey report file required to be on board; .4 information for planning of future surveys; and .5 information which may be used as input for maintenance of classification rules and instructions. 1.3 When a survey is split between different survey stations, a report should be made for each portion of the survey. A list of items surveyed, relevant findings and an indication of whether the item has been credited, should be made available to the next attending surveyor, prior to continuing or completing the survey. Thickness measurement and tank testing carried out should also be listed for the next surveyor. 2 Extent of the survey 2.1 Identification of compartments where an overall survey has been carried out. 2.2 Identification of locations, in each ballast tank and cargo hold including hatch covers and coamings, where a close-up survey has been carried out, together with information on the means of access used. RESOLUTION A.1049(27) adopted on 30 November 2011 INTERNATIONAL CODE ON THE ENHANCED PROGRAMME OF INSPECTIONS DURING SURVEYS OF BULK CARRIERS AND OIL TANKERS, 2001 (2011 ESP CODE)

- 135 - 2.3 Identification of locations, in each ballast tank and cargo hold including hatch covers and coamings, where thickness measurement has been carried out. Note: As a minimum, the identification of location of close-up survey and thickness measurement should include a confirmation with description of individual structural members corresponding to the extent of requirements stipulated in part B of annex A based on type of periodical survey and the ship's age. Where only partial survey is required, e.g. one transverse web, two selected cargo hold transverse bulkheads, the identification should include location within each ballast tank and cargo hold by reference to frame numbers. 2.4 For areas in ballast tanks and cargo holds where protective coating is found to be in good condition and the extent of close-up survey and/or thickness measurement has been specially considered, structures subject to special consideration should be identified. 2.5 Identification of tanks subject to tank testing. 2.6 Identification of piping systems on deck and within cargo holds, ballast tanks, pipe tunnels, cofferdams and void spaces where: .1 examination including internal examination of piping with valves and fittings and thickness measurement, as relevant, has been carried out; and .2 operational test to working pressure has been carried out. 3 Result of the survey 3.1 Type, extent and condition of protective coating in each tank, as relevant (rated GOOD, FAIR or POOR). 3.2 Structural condition of each compartment with information on the following, as relevant: .1 identification of findings, such as: .1 corrosion with description of location, type and extent; .2 areas with substantial corrosion; .3 cracks/fractures with description of location and extent; .4 buckling with description of location and extent; and .5 indents with description of location and extent; .2 identification of compartments where no structural damages/defects are found. The report may be supplemented by sketches/photos; and .3 thickness measurement report should be verified and signed by the surveyor controlling the measurements on board.

- 162 - ANNEX 9 GUIDELINES FOR TECHNICAL ASSESSMENT IN CONJUNCTION WITH PLANNING FOR ENHANCED SURVEYS OF DOUBLE-SIDE SKIN BULK CARRIERS – RENEWAL SURVEY HULL 1 Introduction These guidelines contain information and suggestions concerning technical assessments, which may be of use in conjunction with the planning of enhanced renewal surveys of double- side skin bulk carriers. As indicated in 5.1.5, the guidelines are a recommended tool which may be invoked at the discretion of the Administration, when considered necessary and appropriate, in conjunction with the preparation of the required survey programme. 2 Purpose and principles 2.1 Purpose 2.1.1 The purpose of the technical assessments described in these guidelines is to assist in identifying critical structural areas, nominating suspect areas and in focusing attention on structural elements or areas of structural elements which may be particularly susceptible to, or evidence a history of, wastage or damage. This information may be useful in nominating locations, areas holds and tanks for thickness measurement, close-up survey and tank testing. 2.1.2 Critical structural areas are locations which have been identified from calculations to require monitoring or from the service history of the subject ship or from similar or sister ships (if available) to be sensitive to cracking, buckling or corrosion which would impair the structural integrity of the ship. 2.2 Minimum requirements However, these guidelines may not be used to reduce the requirements pertaining to thickness measurement, close-up survey and tank testing contained in annexes 1 and 2 of part B and in 2.7, respectively, which, in all cases, should be complied with as a minimum. 2.3 Timing As with other aspects of survey planning, the technical assessments described in these guidelines should be worked out by the owner or operator in cooperation with the Administration well in advance of the commencement of the renewal survey, i.e. prior to commencing the survey and normally at least 12 to 15 months before the survey's completion due date. 2.4 Aspects to be considered 2.4.1 Technical assessments, which may include quantitative or qualitative evaluation of relative risks of possible deterioration, of the following aspects of a particular ship may be used as a basis for the nomination of holds, tanks and areas for survey: .1 design features such as stress levels on various structural elements, design details and extent of use of high-tensile steel; .2 former history with respect to corrosion, cracking, buckling, indents and repairs for the particular ship as well as similar vessels, where available; and RESOLUTION A.1049(27) adopted on 30 November 2011 INTERNATIONAL CODE ON THE ENHANCED PROGRAMME OF INSPECTIONS DURING SURVEYS OF BULK CARRIERS AND OIL TANKERS, 2001 (2011 ESP CODE)

- 163 - .3 information with respect to types of cargo carried, use of different holds/tanks for cargo/ballast, protection of holds and tanks and condition of coating, if any. 2.4.2 Technical assessments of the relative risks of susceptibility to damage or deterioration of various structural elements and areas should be judged and decided on the basis of recognized principles and practices, such as may be found in references 2, 3 and 4. 3 Technical assessment 3.1 General 3.1.1 There are three basic types of possible failure, which may be the subject of technical assessment in connection with planning of surveys; corrosion, cracks and buckling . Contact damages are not normally covered by the survey planning since indents are usually noted in memoranda and assumed to be dealt with as a normal routine by surveyors. 3.1.2 Technical assessments performed in conjunction with the survey planning process should, in principle, be as shown schematically in figure 1. The approach is basically an evaluation of the risk in the following aspects based on the knowledge and experience related to: .1 design; and .2 corrosion. 3.1.3 The design should be considered with respect to structural details, which may be susceptible to buckling or cracking as a result of vibration, high stress levels or fatigue. 3.1.4 Corrosion is related to the ageing process, and is closely connected with the quality of corrosion prevention systems fitted at new building, and subsequent maintenance during the service life. Corrosion may also lead to cracking and/or buckling. 3.2 Methods 3.2.1 Design details 3.2.1.1 Damage experience related to the ship in question and sister and/or similar ships, where available, is the main source of information to be used in the process of planning. In addition, a selection of structural details from the design drawings should be included. 3.2.1.2 Typical damage experience to be considered will consist of: .1 number, extent, location and frequency of cracks; and .2 location of buckles. 3.2.1.3 This information may be found in the survey reports and/or the owner's files, including the results of the owner's own inspections. The defects should be analysed, noted and marked on sketches. 3.2.1.4 In addition, general experience should be utilized. Also, reference should be made to reference 2, which contains a catalogue of typical damages and proposed repair methods for various structural details on single-skin bulk carriers. Reference should also be made to RESOLUTION A.1049(27) adopted on 30 November 2011 INTERNATIONAL CODE ON THE ENHANCED PROGRAMME OF INSPECTIONS DURING SURVEYS OF BULK CARRIERS AND OIL TANKERS, 2001 (2011 ESP CODE)

- 164 - reference 3, which contains catalogues of typical damages and proposed repair methods for double-hull oil tanker structural details which may to some extent be similar to structural details in double-side skin bulk carriers. Such figures should be used together with a review of the main drawings, in order to compare with the actual structure and search for similar details that may be susceptible to damage. In particular, chapter 3 of reference 3 deals with various aspects specific to double-hull tankers, such as stress concentration locations, misalignment during construction, corrosion trends, fatigue considerations and areas requiring special attention, while chapter 4 of reference 3 addresses experience gained on structural defects in double-hulls (chemical tankers, OBO carriers, ore/oil carriers, gas carriers), which should also be considered in working out the survey planning. 3.2.1.5 The review of the main structural drawings, in addition to using the above-mentioned figures, should include checking for typical design details where cracking has been experienced. The factors contributing to damage should be carefully considered. 3.2.1.6 The use of high-tensile steel (HTS) is an important factor. Details showing good service experience where ordinary, mild steel has been used may be more susceptible to damage when HTS, and its higher associated stresses, are utilized. There is extensive and, in general, good experience, with the use of HTS for longitudinal material in deck and bottom structures. Experience in other locations, where the dynamic stresses may be higher, is less favourable, e.g. side structures. 3.2.1.7 In this respect, stress calculations of typical and important components and details, in accordance with relevant methods, may prove useful and should be considered. 3.2.1.8 The selected areas of the structure identified during this process should be recorded and marked on the structural drawings to be included in the survey programme. 3.2.2 Corrosion 3.2.2.1 In order to evaluate relative corrosion risks, the following information should generally be considered: .1 usage of tanks, holds and spaces; .2 condition of coatings; .3 cleaning procedures; .4 previous corrosion damage; .5 ballast use and time for cargo holds; .6 risk of corrosion in cargo holds and ballast tanks; and .7 location of ballast tanks adjacent to heated fuel oil tanks. 3.2.2.2 Reference 4 gives definitive examples which can be used for judging and describing coating condition, using typical pictures of conditions. 3.2.2.3 The evaluation of corrosion risks should be based on information in both reference 2 and reference 4, as far as applicable to double-side skin construction, together with relevant information on the anticipated condition of the ship as derived from the information collected in order to prepare the survey programme and the age of the ship. The various holds, tanks and spaces should be listed with the corrosion risks nominated accordingly.

- 165 - 3.2.3 Locations for close-up survey and thickness measurement 3.2.3.1 On the basis of the table of corrosion risks and the evaluation of design experience, the locations for initial close-up survey and thickness measurement (areas and sections) may be nominated. 3.2.3.2 The sections subject to thickness measurement should normally be nominated in tanks, holds and spaces where corrosion risk is judged to be the highest. 3.2.3.3 The nomination of tanks, holds and spaces for close-up survey should initially be based on highest corrosion risk, and should always include ballast tanks. The principle for the selection should be that the extent is increased by age or where information is insufficient or unreliable.

Arrangement and spacing should be determined with due attention to the effectiveness for weathertightness, depending upon the type and the size of the hatch cover, as well as on the stiffness of the cover edges between the securing devices. .2 The net sectional area of each securing device should not be less than: A = 1.4 a/f (cm 2 ) where: a = spacing between securing devices not to be taken less than 2 m f = ( σ Y / 235) e σ Y = specified minimum upper yield stress in N/mm 2 of the steel used for fabrication, not to be taken greater than 70% of the ultimate tensile strength e = 0.75 for σ Y > 235 = 1.0 for σ Y ≤ 235 Rods or bolts should have a net diameter not less than 19 mm for hatchways exceeding 5 m 2 in area. .3 Between cover and coaming and at cross-joints, a packing line pressure sufficient to obtain weathertightness should be maintained by the securing devices. For packing line pressures exceeding 5 N/mm, the cross section area should be increased in direct proportion. The packing line pressure should be specified. .4 The cover edge stiffness should be sufficient to maintain adequate sealing pressure between securing devices. The moment of inertia, I , of edge elements should not be less than: I = 6 p a 4 (cm 4 ) where: p = packing line pressure in N/mm, minimum 5 N/mm a = spacing in metres of securing devices. .5 Securing devices should be of reliable construction and securely attached to the hatchway coamings, decks or covers. Individual securing devices on each cover should have approximately the same stiffness characteristics.

- 171 - ANNEX 12 PROCEDURAL REQUIREMENTS FOR THICKNESS MEASUREMENTS 1 General Thickness measurements required in the context of hull structural surveys, if not carried out by the society itself should be witnessed by a surveyor. The attendance of the surveyor should be recorded. This also applies to thickness measurements taken during voyages. 2 Survey meeting 2.1 Prior to commencement of the renewal or intermediate survey, a meeting should be held between the attending surveyor(s), the owner's representative(s) in attendance and the thickness measurement firm's representative(s) so as to ensure the safe and efficient execution of the surveys and thickness measurements to be carried out on board. 2.2 Communication with the thickness measurement operator(s) and owner's representative(s) should be agreed during the meeting, with respect to the following: .1 reporting of thickness measurements on a regular basis; .2 prompt notification to the surveyor in case of findings such as: .1 excessive and/or extensive corrosion or pitting/grooving of any significance; .2 structural defects like buckling, fractures and deformed structures; .3 detached and/or holed structure; and .4 corrosion of welds. 2.3 The survey report should indicate where and when the meeting took place and who attended (the name of the surveyor(s), the owner's representative(s) and the thickness measurement firm's representative(s)). 3 Monitoring of the thickness measurement process on board 3.1 The surveyor should decide final extent and location of thickness measurements after overall survey of representative spaces on board. 3.2 In case the owner prefers to commence the thickness measurements prior to the overall survey, then the surveyor should advise that the planned extent and locations of thickness measurements are subject to confirmation during the overall survey. Based on findings, the surveyor may require additional thickness measurements to be taken. 3.3 The surveyor should direct the gauging operation by selecting locations such that readings taken represent, on average, the condition of the structure for that area. 3.4 Thickness measurements taken mainly to evaluate the extent of corrosion, which may affect the hull girder strength, should be carried out in a systematic manner such that all longitudinal structural members are gauged, as required.

- 173 - ANNEX B CODE ON THE ENHANCED PROGRAMME OF INSPECTIONS DURING SURVEYS OF OIL TANKERS Part A CODE ON THE ENHANCED PROGRAMME OF INSPECTIONS DURING SURVEYS OF DOUBLE-HULL OIL TANKERS 1 General 1.1 Application 1.1.1 The Code should apply to all self-propelled double-hull oil tankers of 500 gross tonnage and above. 1.1.2 The Code should apply to surveys of hull structure and piping systems in way of cargo tanks, pump-rooms, cofferdams, pipe tunnels, void spaces within the cargo area and all ballast tanks. 1.1.3 The Code contains the minimum extent of examination, thickness measurements and tank testing. The survey should be extended when substantial corrosion and/or structural defects are found and include additional close-up survey when necessary. 1.1.4 The surveys should be carried out during the surveys prescribed by regulation I/10 of the Convention. 1.2 Definitions 1.2.1 Double-hull oil tanker is a ship which is constructed primarily for the carriage of oil in bulk, which has the cargo tanks protected by a double-hull which extends for the entire length of the cargo area, consisting of double sides and double-bottom spaces for the carriage of water ballast or void spaces. 1.2.2 Ballast tank is a tank which is used solely for the carriage of salt water ballast. 1.2.3 Combined cargo/ballast tank, if referred to within the Code, is a tank which is used for the carriage of cargo or ballast water as a routine part of the vessel's operation and will be treated as a Ballast Tank. Cargo tanks in which water ballast might be carried only in exceptional cases per MARPOL regulation I/18.3 are to be treated as cargo tanks. 1.2.4 Overall survey is a survey intended to report on the overall condition of the hull structure and determine the extent of additional close-up surveys. 1.2.5 Close-up survey is a survey where the details of structural components are within the close visual inspection range of the surveyor, i.e. normally within reach of hand. 1.2.6 Transverse section is the cross section of the hull perpendicular to the ship's centerline and includes all longitudinal members such as plating, longitudinals and girders at the deck, sides, bottom, inner bottom and longitudinal bulkheads. RESOLUTION A.1049(27) adopted on 30 November 2011 INTERNATIONAL CODE ON THE ENHANCED PROGRAMME OF INSPECTIONS DURING SURVEYS OF BULK CARRIERS AND OIL TANKERS, 2001 (2011 ESP CODE)

- 174 - 1.2.7 Representative tanks are those which are expected to reflect the condition of other tanks of similar type and service and with similar corrosion prevention systems. When selecting representative tanks, account should be taken of the service and repair history on board and identifiable critical and/or suspect areas. 1.2.8 Suspect areas are locations showing substantial corrosion and/or are considered by the surveyor to be prone to rapid wastage. 1.2.9 Substantial corrosion is an extent of corrosion such that assessment of corrosion pattern indicates a wastage in excess of 75% of allowable margins, but within acceptable limits. For ships built under the IACS Common Structural Rules, substantial corrosion is an extent of corrosion such that the assessment of the corrosion pattern indicates a gauged (or measured) thickness between t net + 0.5mm and t net . 1.2.10 Corrosion prevention system is normally considered a full hard coating. Hard protective coating should usually be epoxy coating or equivalent. Other coating systems, which are neither soft nor semi-hard coatings, may be considered acceptable as alternatives provided that they are applied and maintained in compliance with the manufacturer's specification. 1.2.11 Coating condition is defined as follows: GOOD condition with only minor spot rusting; FAIR condition with local breakdown of coating at edges of stiffeners and weld connections and/or light rusting over 20% or more of areas under consideration, but less than as defined for POOR condition; and POOR condition with general breakdown of coating over 20% or more of areas or hard scale at 10% or more of areas under consideration. 1.2.12 Critical structural areas are locations which have been identified from calculations to require monitoring or from the service history of the subject ship or from similar or sister ships to be sensitive to cracking, buckling or corrosion which would impair the structural integrity of the ship. 1.2.13 Cargo area is that part of the ship which contains cargo tanks, slop tanks and cargo/ballast pump-rooms, cofferdams, ballast tanks and void spaces adjacent to cargo tanks and also deck areas throughout the entire length and breadth of the part of the ship over the above mentioned spaces. 1.2.14 Intermediate survey is a survey carried out either at the second or the third annual survey. 1.2.15 Prompt and thorough repair is a permanent repair completed at the time of survey to the satisfaction of the surveyor, therein removing the need for the imposition of any associated condition of classification or recommendation. 1.2.16 Specially considered (in connection with close-up surveys and thickness measurements) means sufficient close-up inspection and thickness measurements are taken to confirm the actual average condition of the structure under coating. RESOLUTION A.1049(27) adopted on 30 November 2011 INTERNATIONAL CODE ON THE ENHANCED PROGRAMME OF INSPECTIONS DURING SURVEYS OF BULK CARRIERS AND OIL TANKERS, 2001 (2011 ESP CODE)

- 175 - 1.3 Repairs 1.3.1 Any damage in association with wastage over the allowable limits (including buckling, grooving, detachment or fracture), or extensive areas of wastage over the allowable limits, which affects or, in the opinion of the Administration, will affect the ship's structural, watertight or weathertight integrity, should be promptly and thoroughly (see 1.2.15) repaired. Areas to be considered include: .1 bottom structure and bottom plating; .2 side structure and side plating; .3 deck structure and deck plating; .4 watertight or oiltight bulkheads; and .5 hatch covers and hatch coamings, where fitted. For locations where adequate repair facilities are not available, the Administration may allow the ship to proceed directly to a repair facility. This may require discharging the cargo and/or temporary repairs for the intended voyage. 1.3.2 Additionally, when a survey results in the identification of corrosion or structural defects, either of which, in the opinion of the Administration, will impair the ship's fitness for continued service, remedial measures should be implemented before the ship continues in service. 1.4 Surveyors For tankers of 20,000 tons deadweight and above, two surveyors should jointly carry out the first scheduled renewal survey after the tanker passes 10 years of age (i.e. third renewal survey), and all subsequent renewal surveys and intermediate surveys. If the surveys are carried out by a recognized organization, the surveyors should be exclusively employed by such recognized organizations. 1.5 Thickness measurements and close-up surveys In any kind of survey, i.e. renewal, intermediate, annual or other surveys having the scope of the foregoing ones, thickness measurements of structures in areas where close-up surveys are required should be carried out simultaneously with close-up surveys. 2 Renewal survey 2.1 General 2.1.1 The renewal survey may be commenced at the fourth annual survey and be progressed during the succeeding year with a view to completion by the fifth anniversary date. 2.1.2 As part of the preparation for the renewal survey the survey programme should be dealt with in advance of the renewal survey. The thickness measurement should not be carried out before the fourth annual survey.

- 176 - 2.1.3 The survey should include, in addition to the requirements of the annual survey, examination, tests and checks of sufficient extent to ensure that the hull and related piping as required in 2.1.5 is in a satisfactory condition and is fit for its intended purpose for the new period of validity of the Cargo Ship Safety Construction Certificate, subject to proper maintenance and operation and to periodical surveys being carried out at the due dates. 2.1.4 All cargo tanks, ballast tanks, and any other tanks in double-hull spaces, pump-rooms, pipe tunnels, cofferdams and void spaces bounding cargo tanks, decks and outer hull should be examined, and this examination should be supplemented by thickness measurement and testing as required in 2.5 and 2.6, to ensure that the structural integrity remains effective. The aim of the examination is to discover substantial corrosion, significant deformation, fractures, damages or other structural deterioration that may be present. 2.1.5 Cargo piping on deck, including crude oil washing (COW) piping, and cargo and ballast piping within the above tanks and spaces should be examined and operationally tested to working pressure to attending surveyor's satisfaction to ensure that tightness and condition remain satisfactory. Special attention should be given to any ballast piping in cargo tanks and any cargo piping in ballast tanks and void spaces, and surveyors should be advised on all occasions when this piping, including valves and fittings, are open during repair periods and can be examined internally. 2.2 Dry-dock survey 2.2.1 A survey in dry-dock should be a part of the renewal survey. There should be a minimum of two inspections of the outside of the ship's bottom during the five-year period of the Safety Construction Certificate. In all cases, the maximum interval between bottom inspections should not exceed 36 months. 2.2.2 For ships of 15 years of age and over, inspection of the outside of the ship's bottom should be carried out with the ship in dry-dock. For ships of less than 15 years of age, alternate inspections of the ship's bottom not conducted in conjunction with the renewal survey may be carried out with the ship afloat. Inspection of the ship afloat should only be carried out when the conditions are satisfactory and the proper equipment and suitably qualified staff is available. 2.2.3 If a survey in dry-dock is not completed in conjunction with the renewal survey or if the 36 month maximum interval referred to in 2.2.1 is not complied with, the Cargo Ship Safety Construction Certificate should cease to be valid until a survey in dry-dock is completed. 2.2.4 The overall and close-up surveys and thickness measurements, as applicable, of the lower portions of the cargo tanks and ballast tanks should be carried out in accordance with the applicable requirements for renewal surveys, if not already performed. Note: Lower portions of the cargo and ballast tanks are considered to be the parts below light ballast water line. 2.3 Tank corrosion prevention system Where provided, the condition of the corrosion prevention system of cargo tanks should be examined. A ballast tank should be examined at subsequent annual intervals where: .1 a hard protective coating has not been applied from the time of construction; or .2 a soft or semi-hard coating has been applied; or .3 substantial corrosion is found within the tank; or RESOLUTION A.1049(27) adopted on 30 November 2011 INTERNATIONAL CODE ON THE ENHANCED PROGRAMME OF INSPECTIONS DURING SURVEYS OF BULK CARRIERS AND OIL TANKERS, 2001 (2011 ESP CODE)

Thickness measurement should be carried out as deemed necessary by the surveyor. 2.4 Extent of overall and close-up surveys 2.4.1 An overall survey of all tanks and spaces should be carried out at the renewal survey. Suspect areas identified at previous surveys should be examined. 2.4.2 The minimum requirements for close-up surveys at the renewal survey are given in annex 1. 2.4.3 The surveyor may extend the scope of the close-up survey as deemed necessary taking into account the maintenance of the tanks under survey, the condition of the corrosion prevention system and also in the following cases: .1 in particular, tanks having structural arrangements or details which have suffered defects in similar tanks or on similar ships according to available information; and .2 in tanks which have structures with reduced scantlings in association with a corrosion prevention system approved by the Administration. 2.4.4 For areas in tanks where hard protective coatings are found to be in GOOD condition as defined in 1.2.11, the extent of close-up surveys according to annex 1 may be specially considered by the Administration. 2.5 Extent of thickness measurements 2.5.1 The minimum requirements for thickness measurements at the renewal survey are given in annex 2. 2.5.2 Provisions for extended measurements for areas with substantial corrosion are given in annex 4, and may be additionally specified in the survey programme as required in 5.1. These extended thickness measurements should be carried out before the survey is credited as completed. Suspect areas identified at previous surveys should have thickness measurements taken. 2.5.3 The surveyor may further extend the thickness measurements as deemed necessary. 2.5.4 For areas in tanks where hard protective coatings are found to be in GOOD condition as defined in 1.2.11, the extent of thickness measurements according to annex 2 may be specially considered by the Administration. 2.5.5 Transverse sections should be chosen where the largest reductions are suspected to occur or are revealed from deck plating measurements. 2.5.6 In cases where two or three sections are to be measured, at least one should include a ballast tank within 0.5 L amidships. In case of oil tankers of 130 m in length and upwards (as defined in the International Convention on Load Lines in force) and more than 10 years of age, for the evaluation of the ship's longitudinal strength as required in 8.2, the sampling method of thickness measurements is given in annex 12.

These Guidelines are a recommended tool which may be invoked at the discretion of the Administration, when considered necessary and appropriate, in conjunction with the preparation of the required survey programme. 5.2 Conditions for survey 5.2.1 The owner should provide the necessary facilities for a safe execution of the survey. 5.2.1.1 In order to enable the attending surveyors to carry out the survey, provisions for proper and safe access should be agreed between the owner and the Administration. 5.2.1.2 Details of the means of access should be provided in the survey planning questionnaire. 5.2.1.3 In cases where the provisions of safety and required access are judged by the attending surveyors not to be adequate, the survey of the spaces involved should not proceed. 5.2.2 Tanks and spaces should be safe for access. Tanks and spaces should be gas free and properly ventilated. Prior to entering a tank, void or enclosed space, it should be verified that the atmosphere in that space is free from hazardous gas and contains sufficient oxygen. 5.2.3 In preparation for survey and thickness measurements and to allow for a thorough examination, all spaces should be cleaned including removal from surfaces of all loose accumulated corrosion scale. Spaces should be sufficiently clean and free from water, scale, dirt, oil residues, etc., to reveal corrosion, deformation, fractures, damages or other structural deterioration as well as the condition of the coating. However, those areas of structure whose renewal has already been decided by the owner need only be cleaned and descaled to the extent necessary to determine the limits of the areas to be renewed. 5.2.4 Sufficient illumination should be provided to reveal corrosion, deformation, fractures, damages or other structural deterioration as well as the condition of the coating.

When safe access cannot be provided, the soft or semi-hard coating should be removed. 5.2.6 The surveyor(s) should always be accompanied by at least one responsible person, assigned by the owner, experienced in tank and enclosed spaces inspection. In addition a backup team of at least two experienced persons should be stationed at the hatch opening of the tank or space that is being surveyed. The back-up team should continuously observe the work in the tank or space and should keep lifesaving and evacuation equipment ready for use. 5.2.7 A communication system should be arranged between the survey party in the tank or space being examined, the responsible officer on deck and, as the case may be, the navigation bridge. The communication arrangements should be maintained throughout the survey. 5.3 Access to structures 5.3.1 For overall surveys, means should be provided to enable the surveyor to examine the structure in a safe and practical way. 5.3.2 For close-up surveys, one or more of the following means for access, acceptable to the surveyor, should be provided: .1 permanent staging and passages through structures; .2 temporary staging and passages through structures; .3 lifts and moveable platforms; .4 boats or rafts; .5 portable ladders; and .6 other equivalent means. 5.4 Equipment for survey 5.4.1 Thickness measurement should normally be carried out by means of ultrasonic test equipment. The accuracy of the equipment should be proven to the surveyor as required. 5.4.2 One or more of the following fracture detection procedures may be required if deemed necessary by the surveyor: .1 radiographic equipment; .2 ultrasonic equipment; .3 magnetic particle equipment; .4 dye penetrant; and .5 other equivalent means.

A safety checklist should be provided. 5.4.4 Adequate and safe lighting should be provided for the safe and efficient conduct of the survey. 5.4.5 Adequate protective clothing should be made available and used during the survey (e.g. safety helmet, gloves, safety shoes, etc.). 5.5 Surveys at sea or at anchorage 5.5.1 Surveys at sea or at anchorage may be accepted provided the surveyor(s) is given the necessary assistance from the personnel on board. Necessary precautions and procedures for carrying out the survey should be in accordance with 5.1, 5.2, 5.3 and 5.4. 5.5.2 A communication system should be arranged between the survey party in the tank and the responsible officer on deck. This system should also include the personnel in charge of ballast pump handling if boats or rafts are used. 5.5.3 Surveys of tanks by means of boats or rafts may only be undertaken with the agreement of the surveyor, who should take into account the safety arrangements provided, including weather forecasting and ship response under foreseeable conditions and provided the expected rise of water within the tank does not exceed 0.25 m. 5.5.4 When rafts or boats are used for close-up surveys, the following conditions should be observed: .1 only rough duty, inflatable rafts or boats, having satisfactory residual buoyancy and stability even if one chamber is ruptured, should be used; .2 the boat or raft should be tethered to the access ladder and an additional person should be stationed down the access ladder with a clear view of the boat or raft; .3 appropriate lifejackets should be available for all participants; .4 the surface of water in the tank should be calm (under all foreseeable conditions the expected rise of water within the tank should not exceed 0.25 m) and the water level stationary. On no account should the level of the water be rising while the boat or raft is in use; .5 the tank or space must contain clean ballast water only. Even a thin sheen of oil on the water is not acceptable; .6 at no time should the water level be allowed to be within 1 m of the deepest under-deck web face flat so that the survey team is not isolated from a direct escape route to the tank hatch. Filling to levels above the deck transverses should only be contemplated if a deck access manhole is fitted and open in the bay being examined, so that an escape route for the survey party is available at all times. Other effective means of escape to the deck may be considered; and .7 if the tanks (or spaces) are connected by a common venting system, or inert gas system, the tank in which the boat or raft should be used should be isolated to prevent a transfer of gas from other tanks (or spaces).

- 185 - 5.5.5 Rafts or boats alone may be allowed for inspection of the under deck areas of tanks or spaces if the depth of the webs is 1.5 m or less. 5.5.6 If the depth of the webs is more than 1.5 m, rafts or boats alone may be allowed only: .1 when the coating of the under-deck structure is in GOOD condition and there is no evidence of wastage; or .2 if a permanent means of access is provided in each bay to allow safe entry and exit. This means: .1 access direct from the deck via a vertical ladder with a small platform fitted approximately 2 m below the deck in each bay; or .2 access to deck from a longitudinal permanent platform having ladders to deck in each end of the tank. The platform should, for the full length of the tank, be arranged in level with, or above, the maximum water level needed for rafting of under deck structure. For this purpose, the ullage corresponding to the maximum water level should be assumed not more than 3 m from the deck plate measured at the midspan of deck transverses and in the middle length of the tank (see figure 1). If neither of the above conditions are met, then staging or other equivalent means should be provided for the survey of the under-deck areas. 5.5.7 The use of rafts or boats alone in 5.5.5 and 5.5.6 does not preclude the use of boats or rafts to move about within a tank during a survey. 5.6 Survey planning meeting 5.6.1 Proper preparation and close cooperation between the attending surveyor(s) and the owner's representatives on board prior to and during the survey are an essential part in the safe and efficient conduct of the survey. During the survey on board safety meetings should be held regularly. 5.6.2 Prior to commencement of any part of the renewal and intermediate survey, a survey planning meeting should be held between the attending surveyor(s), the owner's representative in attendance, the thickness measurement company operator (as applicable) and the master of the ship or an appropriately qualified representative nominated by the master or company for the purpose of ascertaining that all the arrangements envisaged in the survey programme are in place, so as to ensure the safe and efficient conduct of the survey work to be carried out. 5.6.3 The following is an indicative list of items that should be addressed in the meeting: .1 schedule of the vessel (i.e. the voyage, docking and undocking manoeuvres, periods alongside, cargo and ballast operations, etc.); RESOLUTION A.1049(27) adopted on 30 November 2011 INTERNATIONAL CODE ON THE ENHANCED PROGRAMME OF INSPECTIONS DURING SURVEYS OF BULK CARRIERS AND OIL TANKERS, 2001 (2011 ESP CODE)

- 210 - ANNEX 8 SURVEY REPORTING PRINCIPLES As a principle, for oil tankers subject to the Code, the surveyor should include the following contents in his report for survey of hull structure and piping systems, as relevant for the survey. 1 General 1.1 A survey report should be generated in the following cases: .1 in connection with commencement, continuation and/or completion of periodical hull surveys, i.e. annual, intermediate and renewal surveys, as relevant; .2 when structural damages/defects have been found; .3 when repairs, renewals or modifications have been carried out; and .4 when condition of class (recommendation) has been imposed or deleted. 1.2 The reporting should provide: .1 evidence that prescribed surveys have been carried out in accordance with applicable requirements; .2 documentation of surveys carried out with findings, repairs carried out and condition of class (recommendation) imposed or deleted; .3 survey records, including actions taken, which should form an auditable documentary trail. Survey reports should be kept in the survey report file required to be on board; .4 information for planning of future surveys; and .5 information which may be used as input for maintenance of classification rules and instructions. 1.3 When a survey is split between different survey stations, a report should be made for each portion of the survey. A list of items surveyed, relevant findings and an indication of whether the item has been credited, should be made available to the next attending surveyor, prior to continuing or completing the survey. Thickness measurement and tank testing carried out should also be listed for the next surveyor. 2 Extent of the survey 2.1 Identification of compartments where an overall survey has been carried out. 2.2 Identification of locations, in each tank, where a close-up survey has been carried out, together with information of the means of access used. RESOLUTION A.1049(27) adopted on 30 November 2011 INTERNATIONAL CODE ON THE ENHANCED PROGRAMME OF INSPECTIONS DURING SURVEYS OF BULK CARRIERS AND OIL TANKERS, 2001 (2011 ESP CODE)

- 211 - 2.3 Identification of locations, in each tank, where thickness measurement has been carried out. Note: As a minimum, the identification of location of close-up survey and thickness measurement should include a confirmation with description of individual structural members corresponding to the extent of requirements stipulated in this part of annex B based on type of periodical survey and the ship's age. Where only partial survey is required, i.e. one web frame ring/one deck transverse, the identification should include location within each ballast tank and cargo hold by reference to frame numbers. 2.4 For areas in tanks where protective coating is found to be in good condition and the extent of close-up survey and/or thickness measurement has been specially considered, structures subject to special consideration should be identified. 2.5 Identification of tanks subject to tank testing. 2.6 Identification of piping systems on deck, including crude oil washing (COW) piping, and ballast piping within cargo and ballast tanks, pipe tunnels, cofferdams and void spaces where: .1 examination including internal examination of piping with valves and fittings and thickness measurement, as relevant, has been carried out; and .2 operational test to working pressure has been carried out. 3 Result of survey 3.1 Type, extent and condition of protective coating in each tank, as relevant (rated GOOD, FAIR or POOR), including identification of tanks fitted with anodes. 3.2 Structural condition of each compartment with information on the following, as relevant: .1 Identification of findings, such as: .1 corrosion with description of location, type and extent; .2 areas with substantial corrosion; .3 cracks/fractures with description of location and extent; .4 buckling with description of location and extent; and .5 indents with description of location and extent. .2 Identification of compartments where no structural damage/defects are found. The report may be supplemented by sketches/photographs. .3 Thickness measurement report should be verified and signed by the surveyor controlling the measurements on board.

- 239 - ANNEX 11 GUIDELINES FOR TECHNICAL ASSESSMENT IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE PLANNING OF ENHANCED SURVEYS FOR OIL TANKERS Renewal survey 1 Introduction These Guidelines contain information and suggestions concerning technical assessments which may be of use in conjunction with the planning of renewal surveys of oil tankers. As indicated in 5.1.5, these Guidelines are a recommended tool which may be invoked at the discretion of an Administration, when considered necessary and appropriate, in conjunction with the preparation of the required survey programme. 2 Purpose and principles 2.1 Purpose The technical assessments described in these Guidelines should assist in identifying critical structural areas, nominating suspect areas and in focusing attention on structural elements or areas of structural elements which may be particularly susceptible to, or evidence a history of, wastage or damage. This information may be useful in nominating locations, areas and tanks for thickness measurement, close-up survey and tank testing. 2.2 Minimum requirements These Guidelines may not be used to reduce the requirements of annexes 1, 2 and 3 for close- up survey, thickness measurement and tank testing, respectively, which are, in all cases, to be complied with as a minimum. 2.3 Timing As with other aspects of survey planning, the technical assessments described in these Guidelines should be carried out by the owner or operator in cooperation with the Administration well in advance of the commencement of the renewal survey, i.e. prior to commencing the survey and normally at least 12 to 15 months before the survey's completion due date. 2.4 Aspects to be considered Technical assessments, which may include quantitative or qualitative evaluation of relative risks of possible deterioration, of the following aspects of a particular ship may be used as a basis for the nomination of tanks and areas for survey of: .1 design features such as stress levels on various structural elements, design details and extent of use of high-tensile steel (HTS); .2 former history with respect to corrosion, cracking, buckling, indents and repairs for the particular ship as well as similar vessels, where available; and .3 information with respect to types of cargo carried, use of different tanks for cargo/ballast, protection of tanks and condition of coating, if any. RESOLUTION A.1049(27) adopted on 30 November 2011 INTERNATIONAL CODE ON THE ENHANCED PROGRAMME OF INSPECTIONS DURING SURVEYS OF BULK CARRIERS AND OIL TANKERS, 2001 (2011 ESP CODE)

- 240 - Technical assessments of the relative risks of susceptibility to damage or deterioration of various structural elements and areas should be judged and decided on the basis of recognized principles and practices, such as may be found in references 1 and 2. 3 Technical assessment 3.1 General 3.1.1 There are three basic types of possible failure which may be the subject of a technical assessment in connection with the planning of surveys: corrosion, cracks and buckling. Contact damages are not normally covered by the survey plan since indents are usually noted in memoranda and assumed to be dealt with as normal routine by surveyors. 3.1.2 Technical assessments performed in conjunction with the survey planning process should, in principle, be as shown schematically in figure 1 which depicts how technical assessments can be carried out in conjunction with the survey planning process. The approach is basically an evaluation of the risk, based on the knowledge and experience related to design and corrosion. 3.1.3 The design should be considered with respect to structural details which may be susceptible to buckling or cracking as a result of vibration, high stress levels or fatigue. 3.1.4 Corrosion is related to the ageing process and is closely connected with the quality of corrosion protection at newbuilding and subsequent maintenance during the service life. Corrosion may also lead to cracking and/or buckling. 3.2 Methods 3.2.1 Design details 3.2.1.1 Damage experience related to the ship in question and similar ships, where available, are the main source of information to be used in the process of planning. In addition, a selection of structural details from the design drawings should be included. Typical damage experience to be considered will consist of: .1 number, extent, location and frequency of cracks; and .2 location of buckles. 3.2.1.2 This information may be found in the survey reports and/or the owner's files, including the results of the owner's own inspections. The defects should be analysed, noted and marked on sketches. 3.2.1.3 In addition, general experience should be utilized. For example, reference should be made to reference 1, which contains a catalogue of typical damages and proposed repair methods for various tanker structural details. 3.2.1.4 Such figures should be used together with a review of the main drawings, in order to compare with the actual structure and search for similar details which may be susceptible to damage. An example is shown in figure 2. In particular, chapter 3 of reference 1 deals with various aspects specific to double-hull tankers, such as stress concentration locations, misalignment during construction, corrosion trends, fatigue considerations and areas requiring special attention, which should be considered in working out the survey planning. RESOLUTION A.1049(27) adopted on 30 November 2011 INTERNATIONAL CODE ON THE ENHANCED PROGRAMME OF INSPECTIONS DURING SURVEYS OF BULK CARRIERS AND OIL TANKERS, 2001 (2011 ESP CODE)

- 241 - 3.2.1.5 The review of the main structural drawings, in addition to using the above-mentioned figures, should include checking for typical design details where cracking has been experienced. The factors contributing to damage should be carefully considered. 3.2.1.6 The use of HTS is an important factor. Details showing good service experience where ordinary, mild steel has been used may be more susceptible to damage when HTS, and its higher associated stresses, are utilized. There is extensive and, in general, good experience, with the use of HTS for longitudinal material in deck and bottom structures. Experience in other locations, where the dynamic stresses may be higher, is less favourable, e.g. side structures. 3.2.1.7 In this respect, stress calculations of typical and important components and details, in accordance with relevant methods, may prove useful and should be considered. 3.2.1.8 The selected areas of the structure identified during this process should be recorded and marked on the structural drawings to be included in the survey programme. 3.2.2 Corrosion 3.2.2.1 In order to evaluate relative corrosion risks, the following information is generally to be considered: .1 usage of tanks and spaces; .2 condition of coatings; .3 condition of anodes; .4 cleaning procedures; .5 previous corrosion damage; .6 ballast use and time for cargo tanks; .7 corrosion risk scheme (see reference 2, table 2.1); and .8 location of heated tanks. 3.2.2.2 Reference 2 gives definitive examples which can be used for judging and describing coating condition, using typical pictures of conditions. 3.2.2.3 The evaluation of corrosion risks should be based on information in reference 2, together with the age of the ship and relevant information on the anticipated condition as derived from the information collected in order to prepare the survey programme. 3.2.2.4 The various tanks and spaces should be listed with the corrosion risks nominated accordingly. Special attention should be given to the areas where the double-hull tanker is particularly exposed to corrosion. To this end, the specific aspects addressing corrosion in double-hull tankers indicated in 3.4 (Corrosion trends) of reference 1 should be taken into account. RESOLUTION A.1049(27) adopted on 30 November 2011 INTERNATIONAL CODE ON THE ENHANCED PROGRAMME OF INSPECTIONS DURING SURVEYS OF BULK CARRIERS AND OIL TANKERS, 2001 (2011 ESP CODE)

- 242 - 3.2.3 Locations for close-up survey and thickness measurement 3.2.3.1 On the basis of the table of corrosion risks and the evaluation of design experience, the locations for initial close-up survey and thickness measurement (sections) may be nominated. 3.2.3.2 The sections subject to thickness measurement should normally be nominated in tanks and spaces where corrosion risk is judged to be the highest. 3.2.3.3 The nomination of tanks and spaces for close-up survey should, initially, be based on highest corrosion risk and should always include ballast tanks. The principle for the selection should be that the extent is increased by age or where information is insufficient or unreliable.

- 245 - ANNEX 12 CRITERIA FOR LONGITUDINAL STRENGTH OF HULL GIRDER FOR OIL TANKERS 1 General 1.1 These criteria should be used for the evaluation of the longitudinal strength of the ship's hull girder as required by 8.1.2. 1.2 In order that the ship's longitudinal strength to be evaluated can be recognized as valid, fillet welding between longitudinal internal members and hull envelopes should be in sound condition so as to keep the integrity of longitudinal internal members with hull envelopes. 2 Evaluation of longitudinal strength On oil tankers of 130 m in length and upwards and over 10 years of age, the longitudinal strength of the ship's hull girder should be evaluated in compliance with the requirements of this annex on the basis of the thickness measured, renewed or reinforced, as appropriate, during the renewal survey of the Cargo Ship Safety Construction Certificate or Cargo Ship Safety Certificate (SC renewal survey). The condition of the hull girder for longitudinal strength evaluation should be determined in accordance with the methods specified in appendix 3. 2.1 Calculation of transverse sectional areas of deck and bottom flanges of hull girder 2.1.1 The transverse sectional areas of deck flange (deck plating and deck longitudinals) and bottom flange (bottom shell plating and bottom longitudinals) of the ship's hull girder should be calculated by using the thickness measured, renewed or reinforced, as appropriate, during the SC renewal survey. 2.1.2 If the diminution of sectional areas of either deck or bottom flange exceeds 10% of their respective as-built area (i.e. original sectional area when the ship was built), either one of the following measures should be taken: .1 to renew or reinforce the deck or bottom flanges so that the actual sectional area is not less than 90% of the as-built area; or .2 to calculate the actual section of moduli ( Z act ) of transverse section of the ship's hull girder by applying the calculation method specified in appendix 1, by using the thickness measured, renewed or reinforced, as appropriate, during the SC renewal survey. 2.2 Requirements for transverse section modulus of hull girder 2.2.1 The actual section moduli of the transverse section of the ship's hull girder, calculated in accordance with 2.1.2.2, should satisfy either of the following provisions, as applicable: .1 for ships constructed on or after 1 July 2002, the actual section moduli ( Z act ) of the transverse section of the ship's hull girder calculated in accordance with the requirements of paragraph 2.1.2.2 should be not less than the diminution limits determined by the Administration, taking into account the recommendations adopted by the Organization; or .2 for ships constructed before 1 July 2002, the actual section moduli ( Z act ) of the transverse section of the ship's hull girder calculated in accordance with the requirements of 2.1.2.2 should meet the criteria for minimum section modulus for ships in service required by the Administration or recognized classification society, provided that in no case Z act should be less than the diminution limit of the minimum section modulus ( Z mc ) as specified in appendix 2. RESOLUTION A.1049(27) adopted on 30 November 2011 INTERNATIONAL CODE ON THE ENHANCED PROGRAMME OF INSPECTIONS DURING SURVEYS OF BULK CARRIERS AND OIL TANKERS, 2001 (2011 ESP CODE)

- 246 - Appendix 1 CALCULATION CRITERIA OF SECTION MODULI OF MIDSHIP SECTION OF HULL GIRDER 1 When calculating the transverse section modulus of the ship's hull girder, the sectional area of all continuous longitudinal strength members should be taken into account. 2 Large openings, i.e. openings exceeding 2.5 m in length or 1.2 m in breadth, and scallops, where scallop welding is applied, are always to be deducted from the sectional areas used in the section modulus calculation. 3 Smaller openings (manholes, lightening holes, single scallops in way of seams, etc.) need not be deducted, provided that the sum of their breadths or shadow area breadths in one transverse section does not reduce the section modulus at deck or bottom by more than 3% and provided that the height of lightening holes, draining holes and single scallops in longitudinals or longitudinal girders does not exceed 25% of the web depth, for scallops maximum 75 mm. 4 A deduction-free sum of smaller opening breadths in one transverse section in the bottom or deck area of 0.06( B – Σ b ) (where B = breadth of ship, Σ b = total breadth of large openings) may be considered equivalent to the above reduction in sectional modulus. 5 The shadow area will be obtained by drawing two tangent lines with an opening angle of 30°. 6 The deck modulus is related to the moulded deck line at side. 7 The bottom modulus is related to the base line. 8 Continuous trunks and longitudinal hatch coamings should be included in the longitudinal sectional area provided they are effectively supported by longitudinal bulkheads or deep girders. The deck modulus is then to be calculated by dividing the moment of inertia by the following distance, provided this is greater than the distance to the deck line at side: where: y = distance from neutral axis to top of continuous strength member; x = distance from top of continuous strength member to centerline of the ship; x and y to be measured to the point giving the largest value of y t . 9 Longitudinal girders between multi-hatchways will be considered by special calculations.

- 247 - Appendix 2 DIMINUTION LIMIT OF MINIMUM LONGITUDINAL STRENGTH OF SHIPS IN SERVICE 1 The diminution limit of the minimum section modulus ( Z mc ) of oil tankers in service is given by the following formula: Z mc = cL 2 B ( C b + 0.7 ) k (cm 3 ) where: L = Length of ships. L is the distance, in metres, on the summer load waterline from the fore-side of stem to the after side of the rudder post, or the centre of the rudder stock if there is no rudder post. L is not to be less than 96%, and need not be greater than 97%, of the extreme length on the summer load waterline. In ships with unusual stern and bow arrangement, the length L may be specially considered. B = Greatest moulded breadth in metres. C b = Moulded block coefficient at draught d corresponding to summer load waterline, based on L and B . C b is not to be taken less than 0.6. k = material factor, e.g. k = 1.0 for mild steel with yield stress of 235 N/mm 2 and over k = 0.78 for high-tensile steel with yield stress of 315 N/mm 2 and over k = 0.72 for high-tensile steel with yield stress of 355 N/mm 2 and over. 2 Scantlings of all continuous longitudinal members of the ship's hull girder based on the section modulus requirement in 1 above are to be maintained within 0.4 L amidships. However, in special cases, based on consideration of type of ship, hull form and loading conditions, the scantlings may be gradually reduced towards the end of 0.4 L part, bearing in mind the desire not to inhibit the ship's loading flexibility. 3 However, the above standard may not be applicable to ships of unusual type or design, e.g. for ships of unusual main proportions and/or weight distributions.

- 248 - Appendix 3 SAMPLING METHOD OF THICKNESS MEASUREMENTS FOR LONGITUDINAL STRENGTH EVALUATION AND REPAIR METHODS 1 Extent of longitudinal strength evaluation Longitudinal strength should be evaluated within 0.4 L amidships for the extent of the hull girder length that contains tanks therein and within 0.5 L amidships for adjacent tanks which may extend beyond 0.4 L amidships, where tanks means ballast tanks and cargo tanks. 2 Sampling method of thickness measurement 2.1 Pursuant to the requirements of section 2.5, transverse sections should be chosen such that thickness measurements can be taken for as many different tanks in corrosive environments as possible, e.g. ballast tanks sharing a common plane boundary with cargo tanks fitted with heating coils, other ballast tanks, cargo tanks permitted to be filled with seawater and other cargo tanks. Ballast tanks sharing a common plane boundary with cargo tanks fitted with heating coils and cargo tanks permitted to be filled with seawater should be selected where present. 2.2 The minimum number of transverse sections to be sampled should be in accordance with annex 2. The transverse sections should be located where the largest thickness reductions are suspected to occur or are revealed from deck and bottom plating measurements prescribed in 2.3 and should be clear of areas which have been locally renewed or reinforced. 2.3 At least two points should be measured on each deck plate and/or bottom shell plate required to be measured within the cargo area in accordance with the requirements of annex 2. 2.4 Within 0.1 D (where D is the ship's moulded depth) of the deck and bottom at each transverse section to be measured in accordance with the requirements of annex 2, every longitudinal and girder should be measured on the web and face plate, and every plate should be measured at one point between longitudinals. 2.5 For longitudinal members other than those specified in 2.4 to be measured at each transverse section in accordance with the requirements of annex 2, every longitudinal and girder should be measured on the web and face plate, and every plate should be measured at least in one point per strake. 2.6 The thickness of each component should be determined by averaging all of the measurements taken in way of the transverse section on each component. 3 Additional measurements where the longitudinal strength is deficient 3.1 Where one or more of the transverse sections are found to be deficient in respect of the longitudinal strength requirements given in this annex, the number of transverse sections for thickness measurement should be increased such that each tank within the 0.5 L amidships region has been sampled. Tank spaces that are partially within, but extend beyond, the 0.5 L region, should be sampled. 3.2 Additional thickness measurements should also be performed on one transverse section forward and one aft of each repaired area to the extent necessary to ensure that the areas bordering the repaired section also comply with the requirements of the Code. RESOLUTION A.1049(27) adopted on 30 November 2011 INTERNATIONAL CODE ON THE ENHANCED PROGRAMME OF INSPECTIONS DURING SURVEYS OF BULK CARRIERS AND OIL TANKERS, 2001 (2011 ESP CODE)

- 249 - 4 Effective repair methods 4.1 The extent of renewal or reinforcement carried out to comply with this annex should be in accordance with 4.2. 4.2 The minimum continuous length of a renewed or reinforced structural member should be not less than twice the spacing of the primary members in way. In addition, the thickness diminution in way of the butt joint of each joining member forward and aft of the replaced member (plates, stiffeners, girder webs and flanges, etc.) should not be within the substantial corrosion range (75% of the allowable diminution associated with each particular member). Where differences in thickness at the butt joint exceed 15% of the lower thickness, a transition taper should be provided. 4.3 Alternative repair methods involving the fitting of straps or structural member modification should be subject to special consideration. In considering the fitting of straps, it should be limited to the following conditions: .1 to restore and/or increase longitudinal strength; .2 the thickness diminution of the deck or bottom plating to be reinforced should not be within the substantial corrosion range (75% of the allowable diminution associated with the deck plating); .3 the alignment and arrangement, including the termination of the straps, is in accordance with a standard recognized by the Administration; .4 the straps are continuous over the entire 0.5 L amidships length; and .5 continuous fillet welding and full penetration welds are used at butt welding and, depending on the width of the strap, slot welds. The welding procedures applied should be acceptable to the Administration. 4.4 The existing structure adjacent to replacement areas and in conjunction with the fitted straps, etc., should be capable of withstanding the applied loads, taking into account the buckling resistance and the condition of welds between the longitudinal members and hull envelope plating.

- 250 - Part B CODE ON THE ENHANCED PROGRAMME OF INSPECTIONS DURING SURVEYS OF OIL TANKERS OTHER THAN DOUBLE-HULL OIL TANKERS 1 General 1.1 Application 1.1.1 The Code should apply to self-propelled oil tankers of 500 gross tonnage and above other than double-hull oil tankers, as defined in 1.2.1 of part A of annex B. 1.1.2 The Code should apply to surveys of hull structure and piping systems in way of cargo tanks, pump-rooms, cofferdams, pipe tunnels, void spaces within the cargo area and all ballast tanks. 1.1.3 The Code contains the minimum extent of examination, thickness measurements and tank pressure testing. The survey should be extended when substantial corrosion and/or structural defects are found and include additional close-up survey when necessary. 1.1.4 The surveys should be carried out during the surveys prescribed by regulation I/10 of the Convention. 1.2 Definitions 1.2.1 Ballast tank is a tank which is used solely for the carriage of salt water ballast. 1.2.2 Combined cargo/ballast tank , if referred to within the Code, is a tank which is used for the carriage of cargo or ballast water as a routine part of the ship's operation and will be treated as a ballast tank. Cargo tanks in which water ballast might be carried only in exceptional cases per MARPOL regulation I/18.3 are to be treated as cargo tanks. 1.2.3 Overall survey is a survey intended to report on the overall condition of the hull structure and determine the extent of additional close-up surveys. 1.2.4 Close-up survey is a survey where the details of structural components are within the close visual inspection range of the surveyor, i.e. normally within reach of hand. 1.2.5 Transverse section is the cross section of the hull perpendicular to the ship's centerline and includes all longitudinal members such as plating, longitudinals and girders at the deck, sides, bottom, inner bottom and longitudinal bulkheads. 1.2.6 Representative tanks are those which are expected to reflect the condition of other tanks of similar type and service and with similar corrosion prevention systems. When selecting representative tanks, account should be taken of the service and repair history on board and identifiable critical and/or suspect areas. 1.2.7 Suspect areas are locations showing substantial corrosion and/or are considered by the surveyor to be prone to rapid wastage. 1.2.8 Substantial corrosion is an extent of corrosion such that assessment of corrosion pattern indicates a wastage in excess of 75% of allowable margins, but within acceptable limits. RESOLUTION A.1049(27) adopted on 30 November 2011 INTERNATIONAL CODE ON THE ENHANCED PROGRAMME OF INSPECTIONS DURING SURVEYS OF BULK CARRIERS AND OIL TANKERS, 2001 (2011 ESP CODE)

- 251 - 1.2.9 Corrosion prevention system is normally considered a full hard protective coating. Hard protective coating should usually be epoxy coating or equivalent. Other coating systems, which are neither soft nor semi-hard coatings, may be considered acceptable as alternatives provided that they are applied and maintained in compliance with the manufacturer's specifications. 1.2.10 Coating condition is defined as follows: GOOD condition with only minor spot rusting; FAIR condition with local breakdown of coating at edges of stiffeners and weld connections and/or light rusting over 20% or more of areas under consideration, but less than as defined for POOR condition; POOR condition with general breakdown of coating over 20% or more of areas or hard scale at 10% or more of areas under consideration. 1.2.11 Critical structural areas are locations which have been identified from calculations to require monitoring or from the service history of the subject ship or from similar or sister ships to be sensitive to cracking, buckling or corrosion which would impair the structural integrity of the ship. 1.2.12 Cargo area is that part of the ship which contains cargo tanks, slop tanks and cargo/ballast pump-rooms, cofferdams, ballast tanks and void spaces adjacent to cargo tanks and also deck areas throughout the entire length and breadth of the part of the ship over the above-mentioned spaces. 1.2.13 Intermediate survey is a survey carried out either at the second or third annual survey. 1.2.14 Prompt and thorough repair is a permanent repair completed at the time of survey to the satisfaction of the surveyor, therein removing the need for the imposition of any associated condition of classification or recommendation. 1.2.15 Specially considered (in connection with close-up surveys and thickness measurements) means sufficient close-up inspection and thickness measurements are taken to confirm the actual average condition of the structure under coating. 1.3 Repairs 1.3.1 Any damage in association with wastage over the allowable limits (including buckling, grooving, detachment or fracture), or extensive areas of wastage over the allowable limits, which affects or, in the opinion of the Administration, will affect the ship's structural, watertight or weathertight integrity, should be promptly and thoroughly repaired. Areas to be considered include: .1 side shell frames, their end attachments or adjacent shell plating; .2 deck structure and deck plating; .3 bottom structure and bottom plating; .4 watertight or oiltight bulkheads; and .5 hatch covers and hatch coamings where fitted to combination carriers. RESOLUTION A.1049(27) adopted on 30 November 2011 INTERNATIONAL CODE ON THE ENHANCED PROGRAMME OF INSPECTIONS DURING SURVEYS OF BULK CARRIERS AND OIL TANKERS, 2001 (2011 ESP CODE)

- 252 - Where adequate repair facilities are not available, the Administration may allow the ship to proceed directly to a repair facility. This may require discharging the cargo and/or temporary repairs for the intended voyage. 1.3.2 Additionally, when a survey results in the identification of corrosion or structural defects, either of which, in the opinion of the Administration, will impair the ship's fitness for continued service, remedial measures should be implemented before the ship continues in service. 1.4 Surveyors For tankers of 20,000 tons deadweight and above, two surveyors should jointly carry out the first scheduled renewal survey after the tanker passes 10 years of age (i.e. third renewal survey), and all subsequent renewal surveys and intermediate surveys. If the surveys are carried out by a recognized organization, the surveyors should be exclusively employed by such recognized organizations. 1.5 Thickness measurements and close-up surveys In any kind of survey, i.e. renewal, intermediate, annual or other surveys having the scope of the foregoing ones, thickness measurements of structures in areas where close-up surveys are required should be carried out simultaneously with close-up surveys. 2 Renewal survey 2.1 General 2.1.1 The renewal survey may be commenced at the fourth annual survey and be progressed during the succeeding year with a view to completion by the fifth anniversary date. 2.1.2 As part of the preparation for the renewal survey, the survey programme should be dealt with, in advance of the renewal survey. The thickness measurement should not be held before the fourth annual survey. 2.1.3 The survey should include, in addition to the requirements of the annual survey, examination, tests and checks of sufficient extent to ensure that the hull and related piping as required in 2.1.5 is in a satisfactory condition and is fit for its intended purpose for the new period of validity of the Cargo Ship Safety Construction Certificate, subject to proper maintenance and operation and to periodical surveys being carried out at the due dates. 2.1.4 All cargo tanks, ballast tanks, and any other tanks within the cargo areas which are forming hull structures, pump-rooms, pipe tunnels, cofferdams and void spaces bounding cargo tanks, decks and outer hull should be examined, and this examination should be supplemented by thickness measurement and testing as required in 2.5 and 2.6, to ensure that the structural integrity remains effective. The aim of the examination is to discover substantial corrosion, significant deformation, fractures, damages or other structural deterioration that may be present. 2.1.5 Cargo piping on deck, including crude oil washing (COW) piping, and cargo and ballast piping within the above tanks and spaces should be examined and operationally tested to working pressure to attending surveyor's satisfaction to ensure that tightness and condition remain satisfactory. Special attention should be given to any ballast piping in cargo tanks and any cargo piping in any ballast tanks and void spaces, and surveyors should be advised on all occasions when this piping, including valves and fittings, are open during repair periods and can be examined internally.

- 253 - 2.1.6 The survey extent of combined ballast/cargo tanks should be evaluated based on the records of ballast history and extent of the corrosion prevention system provided. 2.2 Dry-dock survey 2.2.1 A survey in dry-dock should be a part of the renewal survey. There should be a minimum of two inspections of the outside of the ship's bottom during the five-year period of the Cargo Ship Safety Construction Certificate. In all cases, the maximum interval between bottom inspections should not exceed 36 months. 2.2.2 For ships of 15 years of age and over, inspection of the outside of the ship's bottom should be carried out with the ship in dry-dock. For ships of less than 15 years of age, alternate inspections of the ship's bottom not conducted in conjunction with the renewal survey may be carried out with the ship afloat. Inspection of the ship afloat should only be carried out when the conditions are satisfactory and the proper equipment and suitably qualified staff is available. 2.2.3 If a survey in dry-dock is not completed in conjunction with the renewal survey or if the 36 month maximum interval referred to in 2.2.1 is not complied with, the Cargo Ship Safety Construction Certificate should cease to be valid until a survey in dry-dock is completed. 2.2.4 The overall and close-up surveys and thickness measurements, as applicable, of the lower portions of the cargo tanks and ballast tanks should be carried out in accordance with the applicable requirements for renewal surveys, if not already performed. Note: Lower portions of the cargo and ballast tanks are considered to be the parts below light ballast water line. 2.3 Tank corrosion prevention system Where provided, the condition of the corrosion prevention system of cargo tanks should be examined. A ballast tank should be examined at annual intervals where: .1 a hard protective coating has not been applied from the time of construction; or .2 a soft or semi-hard coating has been applied; or .3 substantial corrosion is found within the tank; or .4 the hard protective coating is found to be in less than GOOD condition and the hard protective coating is not repaired to the satisfaction of the surveyor.

The overall and close-up surveys and thickness measurements, as applicable, of the lower portions of the cargo tanks and water ballast tanks should be carried out in accordance with the applicable requirements for intermediate surveys, if not already performed. Note: Lower portions of the cargo and ballast tanks are considered to be the parts below the light ballast water line. 5 Preparations for survey 5.1 Survey programme 5.1.1 The owner in cooperation with the Administration or organization recognized by the Administration should work out a specific survey programme prior to the commencement of any part of: .1 the renewal survey, and .2 the intermediate survey for oil tanker over 10 years of age. The survey programme at intermediate survey may consist of the survey programme at the previous renewal survey supplemented by the condition evaluation report of that renewal survey and later relevant survey reports. The survey programme should be worked out taking into account any amendments to the survey requirements implemented after the last renewal survey carried out. The survey programme should be in a written format based on the information in annex 6A. The survey should not commence until the survey programme has been agreed. 5.1.1.1 Prior to the development of the survey programme, the survey planning questionnaire should be completed by the owner based on the information set out in annex 6B, and forwarded to the Administration. 5.1.2 In developing the survey programme, the following documentation should be collected and consulted with a view to selecting tanks, areas, and structural elements to be examined: .1 survey status and basic ship information; .2 documentation on board, as described in 6.2 and 6.3; .3 main structural plans of cargo and ballast tanks (scantlings drawings), including information regarding use of high-tensile steels (HTS); .4 Condition Evaluation Report, according to annex 9; .5 relevant previous damage and repair history; .6 relevant previous survey and inspection reports from both the recognized organization and the owner; .7 cargo and ballast history for the last 3 years, including carriage of cargo under heated conditions; RESOLUTION A.1049(27) adopted on 30 November 2011 INTERNATIONAL CODE ON THE ENHANCED PROGRAMME OF INSPECTIONS DURING SURVEYS OF BULK CARRIERS AND OIL TANKERS, 2001 (2011 ESP CODE)

- 258 - .8 details of the inert gas plant and tank cleaning procedures; .9 information and other relevant data regarding conversion or modification of the ship's cargo and ballast tanks since the time of construction; .10 description and history of the coating and corrosion protection system (including anodes and previous class notations), if any; .11 inspections of the owner's personnel during the last three years with reference to structural deterioration in general, leakages in tank boundaries and piping and condition of the coating and corrosion protection system (including anodes) if any. Guidance for reporting is shown in annex 5; .12 information regarding the relevant maintenance level during operation, including port State control reports of inspection containing hull related deficiencies, safety management system non-conformities relating to hull maintenance, including the associated corrective action(s); and .13 any other information that will help identify suspect areas and critical structural areas. 5.1.3 The submitted survey programme should account for and comply, as a minimum, with the requirements of 2.6 and annexes 1, 2 and 3 for close-up survey, thickness measurement and tank testing, respectively, and should include relevant information including at least: .1 basic ship information and particulars; .2 main structural plans of cargo and ballast tanks (scantling drawings), including information regarding use of high tensile steels (HTS); .3 plan of tanks; .4 list of tanks with information on their use, corrosion prevention system and condition of coating; .5 conditions for survey (e.g. information regarding tank cleaning, gas freeing, ventilation, lighting, etc.); .6 provisions and methods for access to structures; .7 equipment for surveys; .8 identification of tanks and areas for close-up survey (see 2.4); .9 identification of areas and sections for thickness measurement (see 2.5); .10 identification of tanks for tank testing (see 2.6); .11 identification of the thickness measurement company; .12 damage experience related to the ship in question; and .13 critical structural areas and suspect areas, where relevant.

- 259 - 5.1.4 The Administration will advise the owner of the maximum acceptable structural corrosion diminution levels applicable to the ship. 5.1.5 Use may also be made of the Guidelines for technical assessment in conjunction with the planning of enhanced surveys for tankers, contained in annex 11. These Guidelines are a recommended tool which may be invoked at the discretion of the Administration, when considered necessary and appropriate, in conjunction with the preparation of the required survey programme. 5.2 Conditions for survey 5.2.1 The owner should provide the necessary facilities for a safe execution of the survey. 5.2.1.1 In order to enable the attending surveyors to carry out the survey, provisions for proper and safe access should be agreed between the owner and the Administration. 5.2.1.2 Details of the means of access should be provided in the survey planning questionnaire. 5.2.1.3 In cases where the provisions of safety and required access are judged by the attending surveyors not to be adequate, the survey of the spaces involved should not proceed. 5.2.2 Tanks and spaces should be safe for access. Tanks and spaces should be gas-free and properly ventilated. Prior to entering tank, void or enclosed space, it should be verified that the atmosphere in that space is free from hazardous gas and contains sufficient oxygen. 5.2.3 In preparation for survey and thickness measurements and to allow for a thorough examination, all spaces should be cleaned including removal from surfaces of all loose accumulated corrosion scale. Spaces should be sufficiently clean and free from water, scale, dirt, oil residues, etc., to reveal corrosion, deformation, fractures, damages or other structural deterioration as well as the condition of the coating. However, those areas of structure whose renewal has already been decided by the owner need only be cleaned and descaled to the extent necessary to determine the limits of the areas to be renewed. 5.2.4 Sufficient illumination should be provided to reveal corrosion, deformation, fractures, damages or other structural deterioration as well as the condition of the coating. 5.2.5 Where soft or semi-hard coatings have been applied, safe access should be provided for the surveyor to verify the effectiveness of the coating and to carry out an assessment of the condition of internal structures which may include spot removal of the coating. When safe access cannot be provided, the soft or semi-hard coating should be removed. 5.2.6 The surveyor(s) should always be accompanied by at least one responsible person, assigned by the owner, experienced in tank and enclosed spaces inspection. In addition a backup team of at least two experienced persons should be stationed at the hatch opening of the tank or space that is being surveyed. The back-up team should continuously observe the work in the tank or space and should keep life-saving and evacuation equipment ready for use. 5.2.7 A communication system should be arranged between the survey party in the tank or space being examined, the responsible officer on deck and, as the case may be, the navigation bridge. The communication arrangements should be maintained throughout the survey.

- 261 - 5.5.2 A communication system should be arranged between the survey party in the tank and the responsible officer on deck. This system should also include the personnel in charge of ballast pump handling if boats or rafts are used. 5.5.3 Surveys of tanks by means of boats or rafts may only be undertaken with the agreement of the surveyor, who should take into account the safety arrangements provided, including weather forecasting and ship response under foreseeable conditions and provided the expected rise of water within the tank does not exceed 0.25 m. 5.5.4 When rafts or boats are used for close-up survey the following conditions should be observed: .1 only rough duty, inflatable rafts or boats, having satisfactory residual buoyancy and stability even if one chamber is ruptured, should be used; .2 the boat or raft should be tethered to the access ladder and an additional person should be stationed down the access ladder with a clear view of the boat or raft; .3 appropriate lifejackets should be available for all participants; .4 the surface of water in the tank should be calm (under all foreseeable conditions the expected rise of water within the tank should not exceed 0.25 m) and the water level stationary. On no account should the level of the water be rising while the boat or raft is in use; .5 the tank or space must contain clean ballast water only. Even a thin sheen of oil on the water is not acceptable; .6 at no time should the water level be allowed to be within 1 m of the deepest under-deck web face flat so that the survey team is not isolated from a direct escape route to the tank hatch. Filling to levels above the deck transverses should only be contemplated if a deck access manhole is fitted and open in the bay being examined, so that an escape route for the survey party is available at all times. Other effective means of escape to the deck may be considered; and .7 if the tanks (or spaces) are connected by a common venting system, or inert gas system, the tank in which the boat or raft should be used should be isolated to prevent a transfer of gas from other tanks (or spaces). 5.5.5 Rafts or boats alone may be allowed for inspection of the underdeck areas of tanks or spaces if the depth of the webs is 1.5 m or less. 5.5.6 If the depth of the webs is more than 1.5 m, rafts or boats alone may be allowed only: .1 when the coating of the under-deck structure is in GOOD condition and there is no evidence of wastage; or .2 if a permanent means of access is provided in each bay to allow safe entry and exit. This means: .1 access direct from the deck via a vertical ladder with a small platform fitted approximately 2 m below the deck; and RESOLUTION A.1049(27) adopted on 30 November 2011 INTERNATIONAL CODE ON THE ENHANCED PROGRAMME OF INSPECTIONS DURING SURVEYS OF BULK CARRIERS AND OIL TANKERS, 2001 (2011 ESP CODE)

- 262 - .2 access to deck from a longitudinal permanent platform having ladders to deck in each end of the tank. The platform should, for the full length of the tank, be arranged in level with, or above, the maximum water level needed for rafting of under deck structure. For this purpose, the ullage corresponding to the maximum water level should be assumed not more than 3 m from the deck plate measured at the midspan of deck transverses and in the middle length of the tanks (see figure 1). If neither of the above conditions are met, then staging or other equivalent means should be provided for the survey of the under-deck areas. 5.5.7 The use of rafts or boats alone in 5.5.5 and 5.5.6 does not preclude the use of boats or rafts to move about within a tank during a survey. 5.6 Survey planning meeting 5.6.1 Proper preparation and close cooperation between the attending surveyor(s) and the owner's representatives on board prior to and during the survey are an essential part in the safe and efficient conduct of the survey. During the survey onboard safety meetings should be held regularly. 5.6.2 Prior to commencement of any part of the renewal and intermediate survey, a survey planning meeting should be held between the attending surveyor(s), the owner's representative in attendance, the thickness measurement company operator (as applicable) and the master of the ship or an appropriately qualified representative nominated by the master or company for the purpose to ascertain that all the arrangements envisaged in the survey programme are in place, so as to ensure the safe and efficient conduct of the survey work to be carried out. 5.6.3 The following is an indicative list of items that should be addressed in the meeting: .1 schedule of the ship (i.e. the voyage, docking and undocking manoeuvres, periods alongside, cargo and ballast operations, etc.); .2 provisions and arrangements for thickness measurements (i.e. access, cleaning/de-scaling, illumination, ventilation, personal safety); .3 extent of the thickness measurements; .4 acceptance criteria (refer to the list of minimum thicknesses); .5 extent of close-up survey and thickness measurement considering the coating condition and suspect areas/areas of substantial corrosion; .6 execution of thickness measurements; RESOLUTION A.1049(27) adopted on 30 November 2011 INTERNATIONAL CODE ON THE ENHANCED PROGRAMME OF INSPECTIONS DURING SURVEYS OF BULK CARRIERS AND OIL TANKERS, 2001 (2011 ESP CODE)

- 313 - ANNEX 11 GUIDELINES FOR TECHNICAL ASSESSMENT IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE PLANNING OF ENHANCED SURVEYS FOR OIL TANKERS Renewal survey 1 Introduction These Guidelines contain information and suggestions concerning technical assessments which may be of use in conjunction with the planning of enhanced special surveys of oil tankers. As indicated in 5.1.5, these Guidelines are a recommended tool which may be invoked at the discretion of an Administration, when considered necessary and appropriate, in conjunction with the preparation of the required survey programme. 2 Purpose and principles 2.1 Purpose The purpose of the technical assessments described in these Guidelines is to assist in identifying critical structural areas, nominating suspect areas and in focusing attention on structural elements or areas of structural elements which may be particularly susceptible to, or evidence a history of, wastage or damage. This information may be useful in nominating locations, areas and tanks for thickness measurement, close-up survey and tank testing. 2.2 Minimum requirements These Guidelines may not be used to reduce the requirements of annexes 1, 2 and 3 for close- up survey, thickness measurement and tank testing, respectively, which are, in all cases, to be complied with as a minimum. 2.3 Timing As with other aspects of survey planning, the technical assessments described in these Guidelines should be carried out by the owner or operator in cooperation with the Administration well in advance of the commencement of the renewal survey, i.e. prior to commencing the survey and normally at least 12 to 15 months before the survey's completion due date. 2.4 Aspects to be considered 2.4.1 Technical assessments, which may include quantitative or qualitative evaluation of relative risks of possible deterioration, of the following aspects of a particular ship may be used as a basis for the nomination of tanks and areas for survey: .1 design features such as stress levels on various structural elements, design details and extent of use of high-tensile steel (HTS); .2 former history with respect to corrosion, cracking, buckling, indents and repairs for the particular ship as well as similar vessels, where available; and .3 information with respect to types of cargo carried, use of different tanks for cargo/ballast, protection of tanks and condition of coating, if any. RESOLUTION A.1049(27) adopted on 30 November 2011 INTERNATIONAL CODE ON THE ENHANCED PROGRAMME OF INSPECTIONS DURING SURVEYS OF BULK CARRIERS AND OIL TANKERS, 2001 (2011 ESP CODE)

- 314 - 2.4.2 Technical assessments of the relative risks of susceptibility to damage or deterioration of various structural elements and areas should be judged and decided on the basis of recognized principles and practices, such as may be found in references 1 and 2. 3 Technical assessment 3.1 General 3.1.1 There are three basic types of possible failure which may be the subject of technical assessment in connection with planning of surveys: corrosion, cracks and buckling. Contact damages are not normally covered by the survey plan since indents are usually noted in memoranda and assumed to be dealt with as a normal routine by surveyors. 3.1.2 Technical assessments performed in conjunction with the survey planning process should, in principle, be as shown schematically in figure 1 which depicts, schematically, how technical assessments can be carried out in conjunction with the survey planning process. The approach is basically an evaluation of the risk based on the knowledge and experience related to design and corrosion. 3.1.3 The design should be considered with respect to structural details which may be susceptible to buckling or cracking as a result of vibration, high stress levels or fatigue. 3.1.4 Corrosion is related to the ageing process, and is closely connected with the quality of corrosion protection at newbuilding, and subsequent maintenance during the service life. Corrosion may also lead to cracking and/or buckling. 3.2 Methods 3.2.1 Design details 3.2.1.1 Damage experience related to the ship in question and similar ships, where available, are the main source of information to be used in the process of planning. In addition, a selection of structural details from the design drawings should be included. Typical damage experience to be considered will consist of: .1 number, extent, location and frequency of cracks; and .2 location of buckles. 3.2.1.2 This information may be found in the survey reports and/or the owner's files, including the results of the owner's own inspections. The defects should be analysed, noted and marked on sketches. 3.2.1.3 In addition, general experience should be utilized. For example, reference should be made to reference 1, which contains a catalogue of typical damages and proposed repair methods for various tanker structural details. 3.2.1.4 Such figures should be used together with a review of the main drawings, in order to compare with the actual structure and search for similar details which may be susceptible to damage. An example is shown in figure 2. 3.2.1.5 The review of the main structural drawings, in addition to using the above-mentioned figures, should include checking for typical design details where cracking has been experienced. The factors contributing to damage should be carefully considered. RESOLUTION A.1049(27) adopted on 30 November 2011 INTERNATIONAL CODE ON THE ENHANCED PROGRAMME OF INSPECTIONS DURING SURVEYS OF BULK CARRIERS AND OIL TANKERS, 2001 (2011 ESP CODE)

- 315 - 3.2.1.6 The use of HTS is an important factor. Details showing good service experience where ordinary, mild steel has been used may be more susceptible to damage when HTS, and its higher associated stresses, are utilized. There is extensive and, in general, good experience, with the use of HTS for longitudinal material in deck and bottom structures. Experience in other locations, where the dynamic stresses may be higher, is less favourable, e.g. side structures. 3.2.1.7 In this respect, stress calculations of typical and important components and details, in accordance with relevant methods, may prove useful and should be considered. 3.2.1.8 The selected areas of the structure identified during this process should be recorded and marked on the structural drawings to be included in the survey programme. 3.2.2 Corrosion 3.2.2.1 In order to evaluate relative corrosion risks, the following information is generally to be considered: .1 usage of tanks and spaces; .2 condition of coatings; .3 condition of anodes; .4 cleaning procedures; .5 previous corrosion damage; .6 ballast use and time for cargo tanks; .7 corrosion risk scheme (see reference 2, table 3.1); and .8 location of heated tanks. 3.2.2.2 Reference 2 gives definitive examples which can be used for judging and describing coating condition, using typical pictures of conditions. 3.2.2.3 The evaluation of corrosion risks should be based on information in reference 2, together with the age of the ship and relevant information on the anticipated condition as derived from the information collected in order to prepare the survey programme. 3.2.2.4 The various tanks and spaces should be listed with the corrosion risks nominated accordingly. 3.2.3 Locations for close-up survey and thickness measurement 3.2.3.1 On the basis of the table of corrosion risks and the evaluation of design experience, the locations for initial close-up survey and thickness measurement (sections) may be nominated. 3.2.3.2 The sections subject to thickness measurement should normally be nominated in tanks and spaces where corrosion risk is judged to be the highest. RESOLUTION A.1049(27) adopted on 30 November 2011 INTERNATIONAL CODE ON THE ENHANCED PROGRAMME OF INSPECTIONS DURING SURVEYS OF BULK CARRIERS AND OIL TANKERS, 2001 (2011 ESP CODE)

- 316 - 3.2.3.3 The nomination of tanks and spaces for close-up survey should, initially, be based on highest corrosion risk, and should always include ballast tanks. The principle for the selection should be that the extent is increased by age or where information is insufficient or unreliable.

- 319 - ANNEX 12 CRITERIA FOR LONGITUDINAL STRENGTH OF HULL GIRDER FOR OIL TANKERS 1 General 1.1 These criteria should be used for the evaluation of the longitudinal strength of the ship's hull girder as required by 8.1.2. 1.2 In order that the ship's longitudinal strength to be evaluated can be recognized as valid, fillet welding between longitudinal internal members and hull envelopes should be in sound condition so as to keep the integrity of longitudinal internal members with hull envelopes. 2 Evaluation of longitudinal strength On oil tankers of 130 m in length and upwards and over 10 years of age, the longitudinal strength of the ship's hull girder should be evaluated in compliance with the requirements of this annex on the basis of the thickness measured, renewed or reinforced, as appropriate, during the renewal survey of the Cargo Ship Safety Construction Certificate or Cargo Ship Safety Certificate (SC renewal survey). The condition of the hull girder for longitudinal strength evaluation should be determined in accordance with the methods specified in appendix 3. 2.1 Calculation of transverse sectional areas of deck and bottom flanges of hull girder 2.1.1 The transverse sectional areas of deck flange (deck plating and deck longitudinals) and bottom flange (bottom shell plating and bottom longitudinals) of the ship's hull girder should be calculated by using the thickness measured, renewed or reinforced, as appropriate, during the SC renewal survey. 2.1.2 If the diminution of sectional areas of either deck or bottom flange exceeds 10% of their respective as-built area (i.e. original sectional area when the ship was built), either one of the following measures should be taken: .1 to renew or reinforce the deck or bottom flanges so that the actual sectional area is not less than 90% of the as-built area; or .2 to calculate the actual section of moduli ( Z act ) of transverse section of the ship's hull girder by applying the calculation method specified in appendix 1, by using the thickness measured, renewed or reinforced, as appropriate, during the SC renewal survey. 2.2 Requirements for transverse section modulus of hull girder 2.2.1 The actual section moduli of the transverse section of the ship's hull girder, calculated in accordance with paragraph 2.1.2.2, should satisfy either of the following provisions, as applicable: RESOLUTION A.1049(27) adopted on 30 November 2011 INTERNATIONAL CODE ON THE ENHANCED PROGRAMME OF INSPECTIONS DURING SURVEYS OF BULK CARRIERS AND OIL TANKERS, 2001 (2011 ESP CODE)

- 320 - .1 for ships constructed on or after 1 July 2002, the actual section moduli ( Z act ) of the transverse section of the ship's hull girder calculated in accordance with the requirements of paragraph 2.1.2.2 should be not less than the diminution limits determined by the Administration, taking into account the recommendations adopted by the Organization; or .2 for ships constructed before 1 July 2002, the actual section moduli ( Z act ) of the transverse section of the ship's hull girder calculated in accordance with the requirements of paragraph 2.1.2.2 should meet the criteria for minimum section modulus for ships in service required by the Administration or recognized classification society, provided that in no case Z act should be less than the diminution limit of the minimum section modulus ( Z mc ) as specified in appendix 2. RESOLUTION A.1049(27) adopted on 30 November 2011 INTERNATIONAL CODE ON THE ENHANCED PROGRAMME OF INSPECTIONS DURING SURVEYS OF BULK CARRIERS AND OIL TANKERS, 2001 (2011 ESP CODE)

- 321 - Appendix 1 CALCULATION CRITERIA OF SECTION MODULI OF MIDSHIP SECTION OF HULL GIRDER 1 When calculating the transverse section modulus of the ship's hull girder, the sectional area of all continuous longitudinal strength members should be taken into account. 2 Large openings, i.e. openings exceeding 2.5 m in length or 1.2 m in breadth, and scallops, where scallop welding is applied, are always to be deducted from the sectional areas used in the section modulus calculation. 3 Smaller openings (manholes, lightening holes, single scallops in way of seams, etc.) need not be deducted, provided that the sum of their breadths or shadow area breadths in one transverse section does not reduce the section modulus at deck or bottom by more than 3% and provided that he height of lightening holes, draining holes and single scallops in longitudinals or longitudinal girders does not exceed 25% of the web depth, for scallops of maximum 75 mm. 4 A deduction-free sum of smaller opening breadths in one transverse section in the bottom or deck area of 0.06 ( B – Σ b ) (where B = breadth of ship, Σ b = total breadth of large openings) may be considered equivalent to the above reduction in sectional modulus. 5 The shadow area will be obtained by drawing two tangent lines with an opening angle of 30°. 6 The deck modulus is related to the moulded deck line at side. 7 The bottom modulus is related to the base line. 8 Continuous trunks and longitudinal hatch coamings should be included in the longitudinal sectional area provided they are effectively supported by longitudinal bulkheads or deep girders. The deck modulus is then to be calculated by dividing the moment of inertia by the following distance, provided this is greater than the distance to the deck line at side: where: y = distance from neutral axis to top of continuous strength member; x = distance from top of continuous strength member to centerline of the ship; x and y to be measured to the point giving the largest value of y t . 9 Longitudinal girders between multi-hatchways will be considered by special calculations.

- 322 - Appendix 2 DIMINUTION LIMIT OF MINIMUM LONGITUDINAL STRENGTH OF SHIPS IN SERVICE 1 The diminution limit of the minimum section modulus ( Z mc ) of oil tankers in service is given by the following formula: Z mc = cL 2 B ( C b + 0.7) k (cm 3 ) where: L = Length of ship. L is the distance, in metres, on the summer load waterline from the fore-side of stem to the after-side of the rudder post, or the centre of the rudder stock if there is no rudder post. L is not to be less than 96%, and need not be greater than 97%, of the extreme length on the summer load waterline. In ships with unusual stern and bow arrangement, the length L may be specially considered. B = Greatest moulded breadth in metres. C b = Moulded block coefficient at draught d corresponding to summer load waterline, based on L and B . C b is not to be taken less than 0.6. k = material factor, e.g. k = 1.0 for mild steel with yield stress of 235 N/mm 2 and over k = 0.78 for high-tensile steel with yield stress of 315 N/mm 2 and over k = 0.72 for high-tensile steel with yield stress of 355 N/mm 2 and over. 2 Scantlings of all continuous longitudinal members of the ship's hull girder based on the section modulus requirement in 1 above should be maintained within 0.4 L amidships. However, in special cases, based on consideration of type of ship, hull form and loading conditions, the scantlings may be gradually reduced towards the end of 0.4 L part, bearing in mind the desire not to inhibit the ship's loading flexibility. 3 However, the above standard may not be applicable to ships of unusual type or design, e.g. for ships of unusual main proportions and/or weight distributions.

- 323 - Appendix 3 SAMPLING METHOD OF THICKNESS MEASUREMENTS FOR LONGITUDINAL STRENGTH EVALUATION AND REPAIR METHODS 1 Extent of longitudinal strength evaluation Longitudinal strength should be evaluated within 0.4 L amidships for the extent of the hull girder length that contains tanks therein and within 0.5 L amidships for adjacent tanks which may extend beyond 0.4 L amidships, where tanks means ballast tanks and cargo tanks. 2 Sampling method of thickness measurement 2.1 Pursuant to the requirements of section 2.5, transverse sections should be chosen such that thickness measurements can be taken for as many different tanks in corrosive environments as possible, e.g. ballast tanks sharing a common plane boundary with cargo tanks fitted with heating coils, other ballast tanks, cargo tanks permitted to be filled with sea water and other cargo tanks. Ballast tanks sharing a common plane boundary with cargo tanks fitted with heating coils and cargo tanks permitted to be filled with seawater should be selected where present. 2.2 The minimum number of transverse sections to be sampled should be in accordance with annex 2. The transverse sections should be located where the largest thickness reductions are suspected to occur or are revealed from deck and bottom plating measurements prescribed in 2.3 and should be clear of areas which have been locally renewed or reinforced. 2.3 At least two points should be measured on each deck plate and/or bottom shell plate required to be measured within the cargo area in accordance with the requirements of annex 2. 2.4 Within 0.1 D (where D is the ship's moulded depth) of the deck and bottom at each transverse section to be measured in accordance with the requirements of annex 2, every longitudinal and girder should be measured on the web and face plate, and every plate should be measured at one point between longitudinals. 2.5 For longitudinal members other than those specified in 2.4 to be measured at each transverse section in accordance with the requirements of annex 2, every longitudinal and girder should be measured on the web and face plate, and every plate should be measured at least in one point per strake. 2.6 The thickness of each component should be determined by averaging all of the measurements taken in way of the transverse section on each component. 3 Additional measurements where the longitudinal strength is deficient 3.1 Where one or more of the transverse sections are found to be deficient in respect of the longitudinal strength requirements given in this annex, the number of transverse sections for thickness measurement should be increased such that each tank within the 0.5 L amidships region has been sampled. Tank spaces that are partially within, but extend beyond, the 0.5 L region, should be sampled. 3.2 Additional thickness measurements should also be performed on one transverse section forward and one aft of each repaired area to the extent necessary to ensure that the areas bordering the repaired section also comply with the requirements of the Code.

- 324 - 4 Effective repair methods 4.1 The extent of renewal or reinforcement carried out to comply with this annex should be in accordance with 4.2. 4.2 The minimum continuous length of a renewed or reinforced structural member should be not less than twice the spacing of the primary members in way. In addition, the thickness diminution in way of the butt joint of each joining member forward and aft of the replaced member (plates, stiffeners, girder webs and flanges, etc.) should not be within the substantial corrosion range (75% of the allowable diminution associated with each particular member). Where differences in thickness at the butt joint exceed 15% of the lower thickness, a transition taper should be provided. 4.3 Alternative repair methods involving the fitting of straps or structural member modification should be subject to special consideration. In considering the fitting of straps, it should be limited to the following conditions: .1 to restore and/or increase longitudinal strength; .2 the thickness diminution of the deck or bottom plating to be reinforced should not be within the substantial corrosion range (75% of the allowable diminution associated with the deck plating); .3 the alignment and arrangement, including the termination of the straps, is in accordance with a standard recognized by the Administration; .4 the straps are continuous over the entire 0.5 L amidships length; and .5 continuous fillet welding and full penetration welds are used at butt welding and, depending on the width of the strap, slot welds. The welding procedures applied should be acceptable to the Administration. 4.4 The existing structure adjacent to replacement areas and in conjunction with the fitted straps, etc., should be capable of withstanding the applied loads, taking into account the buckling resistance and the condition of welds between the longitudinal members and hull envelope plating.
