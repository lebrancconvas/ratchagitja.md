ANNEX AMENDMENTS TO THE INTERNATIONAL CODE OF SAFETY FOR SHIPS USING GASES OR OTHER LOW-FLASHPOINT FUELS (IGF CODE) PART A-1 SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS FOR SHIPS USING NATURAL GAS AS FUEL 6 – FUEL CONTAINMENT SYSTEM 6.7 Regulation for pressure relief system 1 Regulation 6.7.1.1 is replaced by the following: "All fuel storage tanks shall be provided with a pressure relief system appropriate to the design of the fuel containment system and the fuel being carried. Fuel storage hold spaces, interbarrier spaces and tank connection spaces, which may be subject to pressures beyond their design capabilities, shall also be provided with a suitable pressure relief system. Pressure control systems specified in 6.9 shall be independent of the pressure relief systems." 11 – FIRE SAFETY 2 The following new regulation 11.8 is added after existing regulation 11.7: " 11.8 Regulation for fuel preparation room fire-extinguishing systems For ships constructed on or after 1 January 2024, fuel preparation rooms containing pumps, compressors or other potential ignition sources shall be provided with a fixed fire-extinguishing system complying with the provisions of SOLAS regulation II-2/10.4.1.1 and taking into account the necessary concentrations/application rate required for extinguishing gas fires." PART B-1 16 – MANUFACTURE, WORKMANSHIP AND TESTING 16.3 Welding of metallic materials and non-destructive testing for the fuel containment system 3 Regulation 16.3.3.5.1 is replaced by the following: ".1 tensile tests: cross-weld tensile strength is not to be less than the specified minimum tensile strength for the appropriate parent materials. For materials such as aluminium alloys, reference shall be made to 6.4.12.1.1.3 with regard to the regulations for weld metal strength of under-matched welds (where the weld metal has a lower tensile strength than the parent metal). In every case, the position of fracture shall be recorded for information;" RESOLUTION MSC.475(102) (adopted on 11 November 2020) AMENDMENTS TO THE INTERNATIONAL CODE OF SAFETY FOR SHIPS USING GASES OR OTHER LOW-FLASHPOINT FUELS (IGF CODE)
