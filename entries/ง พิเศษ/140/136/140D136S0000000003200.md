CHAPTER 13 - ARRANGEMENT OF MEANS OF ESCAPE 1 Application This chapter details the specifications for means of escape as required by chapter II-2 of the Convention. 2 Passenger ships 2.1 Width of stairways 2.1.1 Basic requirements for stairway width Stairways shall not be less than 900 mm in clear width. The minimum clear width of stairways shall be increased by 10 mm for every one person provided for in excess of 90 persons. The total number of persons to be evacuated by such stairways shall be assumed to be two thirds of the crew and the total number of passengers in the areas served by such stairways. The width of the stairways shall not be inferior to those determined by paragraph 2.1.2. 2.1.2 Calculation method of stairway width 2.1.2.1 Basic principles of the calculation 2.1.2.1.1 This calculation method determines the minimum stairway width at each deck level, taking into account the consecutive stairways leading into the stairway under consideration. 2.1.2.1.2 It is the intention that the calculation method shall consider evacuation from enclosed spaces within each main vertical zone individually and take into account all of the persons using the stairway enclosures in each zone, even if they enter that stairway from another vertical zone. 2.1.2.1.3 For each main vertical zone the calculation shall be completed for the night time (case 1) and day time (case 2) and the largest dimension from either case used for determining the stairway width for each deck under consideration. 2.1.2.1.4 The calculation of stairway widths shall be based upon the crew and passenger load on each deck. Occupant loads shall be rated by the designer for passenger and crew accommodation spaces, service spaces, control spaces and machinery spaces. For the purpose of the calculation the maximum capacity of a public space shall be defined by either of the following two values: the number of seats or similar arrangements, or the number obtained by assigning 2 m 2 of gross deck surface area to each person. RESOLUTION MSC.98(73) (adopted on 5 December 2000) ADOPTION OF THE INTERNATIONAL CODE FOR FIRE SAFETY SYSTEMS

- 25 - 2.1.2.2 Calculation method for minimum value 2.1.2.2.1 Basic formulae In considering the design of stairway widths for each individual case which allow for the timely flow of persons evacuating to the assembly stations from adjacent decks above and below, the following calculation methods shall be used (see figures 1 and 2): when joining two decks: W=(N 1 +N 2 ) 10mm; when joining three decks: W=(N 1 +N 2 +0.5N 3 ) 10mm; when joining four decks: W=(N 1 +N 2 +0.5N 3 +0.25N 4 ) 10mm; and when joining five decks or more decks, the width of the stairways shall be determined by applying the above formula for four decks to the deck under consideration and to the consecutive deck, where: W = the required tread width between handrails of the stairway. The calculated value of W may be reduced where available landing area S is provided in stairways at the deck level defined by subtracting P from Z, such that: P = S x 3.0 persons/m 2 ; and P max = 0.25Z where: Z = the total number of persons expected to be evacuated on the deck being considered P = the number of persons taking temporary refuge on the stairway landing, which may be subtracted from Z to a maximum value of P = 0.25Z (to be rounded down to the nearest whole number) S = the surface area (m 2 ) of the landing, minus the surface area necessary for the opening of doors and minus the surface area necessary for accessing the flow on stairs (see figure 1) N = the total number of persons expected to use the stairway from each consecutive deck under consideration; N 1 is for the deck with the largest number of persons using that stairway; N 2 is taken for the deck with the next highest number of persons directly entering the stairway flow such that, when sizing the stairway width as each deck level, N 1 > N 2 > N 3 > N 4 (see figure 2). These decks are assumed to be on or upstream (i.e., away from the embarkation deck) of the deck being considered.

Where several assembly stations are in one main vertical zone, the stairway width shall not decrease in the direction of the evacuation to the most distant assembly station. 2.2 Details of stairways 2.2.1 Handrails Stairways shall be fitted with handrails on each side.

Provision shall also be made for an alternative supply of cooling water. 2.2.2.2 Filters or equivalent devices shall be fitted to minimize the amount of water carried over to the inert gas blowers. 2.2.2.3 The scrubber shall be located aft of all cargo tanks, cargo pump-rooms and cofferdams separating these spaces from machinery spaces of category A. 2.2.3 Blowers 2.2.3.1 At least two blowers shall be fitted and be capable of delivering to the cargo tanks at least the volume of gas required by paragraphs 2.2.1.2 and 2.2.1.3. For systems with gas generators the Administration may permit only one blower if that system is capable of delivering the total volume of gas required by paragraphs 2.2.1.2 and 2.2.1.3 to the protected cargo tanks, provided that sufficient spares for the blower and its prime mover are carried on board to enable any failure of the blower and its prime mover to be rectified by the ship's crew. 2.2.3.2 The inert gas system shall be so designed that the maximum pressure which it can exert on any cargo tank will not exceed the test pressure of any cargo tank. Suitable shutoff arrangements shall be provided on the suction and discharge connections of each blower.

The fluxmeter should be water-cooled and capable of measuring heat flux 0 to 60 kW/m 2• The fluxmeter should be calibrated at least once a year against a standard device. 3.2 The fluxmeter should be placed perpendicular to the centre of the window being tested, and in a position such that the centre of the fluxmeter's view coincides with the centre of the window (see the figure). The fluxmeter should be located at a distance greater than 0.5 m from the window, such that the view of the fluxmeter just includes part of the frame. However, the fluxmeter should not be located more than 2.5 m from the window. The dimension of the bOlmdary and window frame seen by the fluxmeter, which remains outside the window should not exceed 10% of the total width seen by the fluxmeter on the surface of the sample.
